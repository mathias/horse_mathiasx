YouTube videos not loading on the tumblr tumblog. I guess I'll have to go to YouTube.
Robert Scoble sure twitters a lot. Also, they're holding a party here in a few minutes and so I doubt I'm going to get much work done now.

Beethoven, play me out..
Writing emails.
Turkey burgers and spanish rice for dinner.

SNL

Night has fallen.

Listening to Miles Davis and wishing I could listen to Kind of Blue forever.

Gah. Getting late, need some sleepz0r soon.
Back from classes / grocery shopping. Dinner, H/W, House MD, H/W in that order.
Another paper is done. Not perfect, but hopefully the professor will appreciate the sleep deprivation he's caused me for the past two weeks.
This doesn't seem to be a new Lost. wtf, ABC.
Did the digg party start yet? Apparently I don't know diggers cool enough to give me twitter updates on stuff like that.
Sitting outside, with laptop and a mug of peppermint tea, watching the sun go down.
Looking for a place to live for the next year. Not having much luck :-/
Gah. I should've gone to Minnebar. Instead I'm stuck in my apartment, with a cold, playing tower defense.
Why is it that Swordfish is a so-bad-its-good movie?
Cruising sites for jobs and apartments. So far no luck.
I haven't twittered in awhile. Guess what I'm doing. Here's a hint: It doesn't involve a computer.
At home, catching up on feeds.
Trying to finish up some H/W before I need to sleep.
Chatting on AIM
Catching up on my feeds, which seem to be growing exponentially.
Just made it through 3 days of constant burnout, aka 3 papers and 2 exams. Now I just have to study for one more exam and worry about finals
I've been using Flock as a newsreader on my laptop, but it's borked from too many feeds. Suggestions for a mac-based rss reader, twitters?
Time to catch up on RSS feeds.
Math exam today was killer, but I think I nailed it.
Macmini's frontrow on shuffle, shop on amazon, chill out a little bit before studying.
Coffee, folk music, and staring at the sun. a good combination.
Listening to some Big Top Chautauqua - www.bigtop.org
Yawn. Saturday.
Anyone want to brainstorm some stuff to present at Barcamp Chicago this summer?

Cooking is taking forever. Gotta make sure I cook all the evil out of the ground turkey
Heh, the redneck neighbors saw me outside reading a book, so they came over & said that they had a sudden need to mow & that I had to leave.
whatever random anime is on adultswim, then sleep. big day tomorrow.
google reader only says 100+ unread, and that's good because I probably wouldn't even start reading if I knew it really meant 5500+ unread:)
Google Reader turns out to be pretty good for my new RSS reader, as it works a lot like gmail and I like that.
Very behind on feeds, I'm thinking that google news produces too many things/day for me to use for my current events updates
My VerizonKRZR has too short of battery life. I'm thinking of going with either a MotoQ or Blackberry. What do you guys think?
Is anyone going to chicago on thurs to check out the barcamp venue?
Why doesn't Google Reader let me search through RSS feeds like Gmail lets me search my mail?
Writing
Cool app of the day - toggl.com (thanks Lifehacker!)
Every time a bird chirps outside, I think I've got a new twitter. I'm like Pavlov's dogs.
hoping this french press coffee knows how to cure my sleep dep-induced headache
I need to sleep now. Another final tomorrow morning.
Doing nothing - should be studying math though.
Watching anime (Serial Experiments Lain) on youtube to determine if I want to splurge and buy the whole set.
Just threw out all the old newspapers in the duplex. Why keep old news around when it's all index online?
Ugh, that coffee was so nasty. No wonder I hate drip coffee.
Playing with Ruby on Rails
According to my 4 year old cousin, with my bluetooth headset and Raybans, I've become a "cyborg-Terminator guy" of sorts.
I'm looking for a blog: the guy works at Amazon and wrote about their interview process and why they code in C/C++. Can anyone help me out?
Done with finals. Relax and do some reading now :)
Does anyone know how to set up tikiwiki as a CMS? thanks in advance
Explaining "the long tail" to my dad, anyone want to help me out? :)
Lots of new-ish science-y books coming from Amazon, along with cheap textbooks for my summer clasess. Hooray!
Drinking coffee, reading feeds. Secret Agent Radio stream from SOMA.fm. All is good.
@raster: I work mostly from home. I guess I need a stationary bike to make this work?
Has anyone actually ever had to replace the AA's in a Microsoft wireless mouse? I've had mine for over a year and it still hasa 6 foot range
Back from the concert. My ears won't stop ringing.
At the Rave in milw
I figured out how to make a really good soy milk latte now. yay coffee.
recorded a new voicemail message so that Captain Jean Luc Picard handles all my calls on hailing frequencies.
Reading a book, despite the headache - Tylenol didn't help. hrm.
In Madison, WI. Family get-together
Sleeping.
tired. monday is almost here.
I think I found a new place to live. Preventing my own homelessness is always a good thing.
blah. apartment hunting today.. no fun.
thanks, topher. I've gotta run down to Ikea on Friday and get some cheap furniture, since I don't own any.
Found an apartment; it's a studio but it's very nice & new. Moving in in the next week. w00t!
Milwaukee today, Shaumburgh IL tomorrow, in the futurez: THE MOON.
Any suggestions for broadband in SE Wisconsin? TDS, Verizon, and Time Warner Cable seem to be my choices.
I know I've been in Google Reader too long when I look to find the "Mark as read" button at the bottom of my gmail messages.
my ikea spending spree: 
Nanotechnology is so cool. Will someone hurry up and create me a swarm of supercomputing dust already?
According to some survey-type website, factoring in my lifestyle and health conditions, my "realage" is 27.5 years old. Ouch.
Signed a lease on my apartment today. Move in next week after the clean / put up shades on windows
dinner: morningstar vegartarian burgers on wheat buns, w00t.
jeep had a dead battery.. jumped it, drove to gas station, bought liquid gold (gasoline), jumped it again at the station, drove home, gah.
coffee ftw. home made espresso is the best!
Appealing some financial aid office bureaucracy this morning, dealing with other college admin this afternoon. Then hopefully a nap.
Time to watch Aqua Teen and later, sleep.
Fixing wifi issues. Seems to work now.
Watching some little ducks that have decided that the ditch by the road would be a good new home.
It's hot and windy and so it kind of sucks to open up the windows and have everything in the house form a mini-tornado.
Trying to do every single piece of laundry that needs to be clean after I move into the new apart.. blah. I don't like laundry.
Scheduling and planning and cleaning and packing more stuff.
Ordering 4mbs DSL for my apartment. w00t!
My net connection has been spotty, and in a few days I'll be totally without any internet access. I'm *so* looking forward to that.

A song to start my friday: 
I never really got the point of watching the Food Network while eating. I never really got the point of having the TV on while eating though
Haircut in 20 min at a sort of men's 'barbershop' salon. I'm trying to act/look more professional and adult or something.
Planning a way to use Stikkit's API to trade data with my PDA (Apple Newton, which I'm never really used for PIM)
Won an auction on a Newton charger, happened to see another eMate for sale and bid on it, too. Newtons are addicting, apparently.
I need to consolidate my 'web 2.0' tools; the featuresets are all overlapping.. Stikkits, Google products, 37signals, time tracking services
Lazy Sunday. Luckily, I didn't wake up in the afternoon, nor called Parnell to see what he's doin.
Ghost in th Shell on adultswim and then sleep; so very tired from helping my uncle move and I've got to do it myself yet.
At least another two trips to move all my stuff in the new apartment. I'll save that for tomorrow and read some now.
All moved into my new apartment, but no internet service for a few days. DVDs until then i guess
It is raining in torrents
My apartment is right across the street from Lake Michigan and today I'm just watching the waves as the fog rolls in. Very relaxing.
Not getting the 4mbps speed I was promised, though, so I don't think I'll be paying the expensive rates for service, either.
I'm online! Finally!
Got the DSL modem today from the phone company, but theyre taking their sweet time on turning on my service, considering I ordered it 1.5 we

Plane just flew by pulling a Geico insurance banner, is pretty normal, but it was an old deHavilland Beaver. Digicam didn't have enough zoom
I have a file with my ISP's customer service, I'm sure. I've called at least 11 or 12 times, but they were always nice and I was never angry
Switching my internet service down too the 1mbps package because thats all they can deliver and its much cheaper.
How did my cellphone go from a full charge last night when I went to sleep to dead battery in the morning? Very suspicious.
The beast awakens, craving coffee and sunlight. "Must.. have.. coffee.." the zombie growls. Just another morning.
That twitter was much delayed due to the storm knocking out my connection. Very nice.
Another ghost-riders-in-the-sky-inspired storm just rolled in. I love the lake.
Drinking coffee, then hop in the car, attempt to pick up one cousin, then go to my uncle's house to visit other various cousins.
It's Caturday!
Spending some time making sure my todo lists and peeps in Stikkits are using Markdown, which I hadn't really used in the past.
Lego Star Wars II wasn't that great. Any recommendations for fun little Mac OSX games?
Trying out the demo for Lego Star Wars II on my Mac. Haven't really used my mac for game-playing other than flash tower defense stuff.
Just finished eating dinner
Tired. Guess I'll watch some Diggnation.
My roomba iz cleanin' the house, dragging stuff around and knocking things over. Fun to watch.
gonna make some coffee, wake up these bones..
The city brass band ended up playing 2 hours. They weren't bad.
A gang of Vespa riders just went by, which is sort of a whirring noise. I kid you not.. Vespas. Heh.
Haha, I do believe this song is called "Springtime for Hitler" Very nice.
Correction: they're the city brass band. they just played the Star Spangled Banner and got interrupted by someones car blasting rap
I wish all the loud Harley motorcycles and Civics with coffee can mufflers would go away so I could hear the city jazz band across the steet
Don't tell the Scifi Channel, but I just happen to now have all of the short stories from their archives that they're deleting.
that was @Pete & @KevRon, @others as well, heh.
Yeah, I don't know Chicago and don't know if I'll go; but it's an easy train ride from here and probably wider range of people than Madison
Coffee update: Yuban Organic is cheap and a tasty medium roast. That is all.
The Barcamp Chicago site seems to be dead anyways, so I don't know if I'll sign up.
Who on twitter is going to Barcamp Chicago?
Starting to read a couple new books that came via my Amazon Prime account today.
Making the droid (roomba) do my bidding
Going to the hospital today. Always a (not) fun time to be had there!
@merlin: Twitter the service, Tweeter the user?
Heh, going to the Velodrome to watch track bike racing this Sat. instead of BarCamp Chicago.
No BarCamp Chicago for me this weekend - too sick.
Man my twitter-lag is a good 30 minutes. What's wrong with Twitter?
Slept in. Just woke up, chilling on the porch in the sun with bob marley and the wailers playing. Gonna be a good day.
Sorry for ignoring you, Twitter, but I've been really busy with my class and "reading" and "studying" as twitters for 4 weeks is not good
Can someone nicely give me an invite to Pownce? I seem to be late to the party..
I'm on pownce now. thanks guys!
Still can't get a Wisconsin's drivers license, and I'm fairly sure there's no way I could get a US passport at this point.Almost like prison
Second Life is down today, and it is supposed to be my summer college class's virtual meeting date there right now. Heh, too bad.
Decided: Pownce is where some of my friends are, and we can talk like friends. Twitter is where I hear blog posts from Robert Scoble & Co.
Working on a wiki entry on a class wiki for a summer class. Wow, that's a really redundant description.
I can still go on vacation and not be overwhelmed by my RSSfeeds, mainly thanks to Google Reader and applying Merlin Mann's ideas for email.
I hate RSS feeds with truncated stories, because I'm usually using Google Reader offline now and can't just click and load the whole post :(
On vacation. Got sunburned from being out sea kayaking all day, and had a gourmet dinner. Yes, you can envy me now.
Drove from northern Wisconsin to my parent's house today. Back to Milwaukee area on Sunday, then home to Kenosha Sunday night.
@ashleydryden re: moo cards. What info is considered kosher to put on those and what shouldn't I put? I can never decide when I go to order.
insert "iPhone" for hiptop cellphone in that idea and it still works, it's just way cooler then.
And you'd just grab the syllabus and the teacher would understand you know how to read it because all syllabi look the same. Heh.
@nungana , in an XML world, there would be a microformat similar to hResume called hSyllabus, that a "classware"-enabled hiptop phone read.
Built some of the new furniture for my apartment. Now I'm going to chill out, watch a Diggnation, then read all night.
What's the most important stuff to put on business cards? (or in this case, moo cards?) I'm a student, so they're not for business.
Nevermind, I wasn't following @Web414. This should work, though.
@Web414 testing 1 2 3? Does this help, Pete?
updated facebook, I guess. Wait, so facebook isn't just for college kids anymore? I'm so out of touch.
Back in Kenosha after driving all day and visiting various Wisconsin-based relatives.
BarCamp Block video on podtech: 
I wish my macmini was an on UPS (or my laptop's battery wasn't dead) so that I can continue reading my feeds in the inevitable power outage.
More thunderstorms on the way, with more storm systems behind them.
Stuck a latenight freeform codeathon event on the barcampMilwaukee site, 'cuz I want to do some coding. Alsoconsidering 20min lightning demo
Added Twitter app to my Facebook profile. Uhh, yeah, because now facebook is totally 10x as 'fun'... :/
@scobleizer all I ever get these days is bacn, so I'm glad there's a word for it now. Personal communication seems to have moved elsewhere.
Sitting at the DMV, trying to get a drivers license for the tenth time or so
Created new gmail label - bacn - removed all the old site-specific labels and changed all the filters to label as bacn, including twitspam:)
Photo uploads going kind of slow.. lots more to go, then tag and desc them all. Nice.
I thought long URLs in a twitter messages got a tinyURL automagically, but I guess not.
Okay, URLs with at-symbols don't work on Twitter. Let me try that again: 
Uploading photos from my vacation to zooomr. Check it out at 
Grinding up some tasty Alterra Guatemalan coffee.
4hr workweek rule: fire the 20% of your customers that cause 80% of the problems.
A week + the rest of today until my birthday. Dunno whether to be excited or just indifferent to it.
 Erlang: The Movie!
Has anyone looked at BitFrost from the OLPC project and would like to talk about it at #barcampmilw2 ? 
To coffee or not to coffee, that is the question..
Too. Hot. :(
Listening to music, making some (late) lunch, drinking some tea. Then I'll tackle some new books.
Got up at 5AM to look at the lunar eclipse this morning, but it was sunny out and I was tired, so I went back to sleep instead.
Weird dream moment: Literally dreaming typing the phrase "I don't know why I'm getting into such detail about acquiring tweezers.."
Certain websites idle out for me, but google, twitter and flickr work. Maybe a line got cut somewhere? Thereslots of road construction here.
@ashleydryden vegetarians are just more vocal, maybe :)
Any else getting Twitters out of order in Twitteriffic or other clients?
I could always bring a few vegetarian things to eat, I guess.
I need veggie food too :)
woot. 12 filters in gmail form the bulk of my bacn rules system. It works pretty well: new bacn that isn't tagged immediately gets a filter.
At some point communication left the browser and became desktop apps. Now all my communication is back in the browser: gmail, twitter, etc.
hacking on erlang ftw.
Slow night on twitter, pownce, and my email. At least I got some laundry done; how's that for useless twitter updates? :)
Liking the music that is coming through on the BCMilw2 last.fm radio thingy.
Brewing some coffee to jumpstart my brain.
Twitter is broken, or at least pretending it's on a 200px wide  cellphone screen.
@raster "do something about barcampmadison.com" in what sense?
@raster I'm not a web-dev, which seems to be the main interest. Maybe a microformats session? I couldn't lead it alone, but would be game.
Okay, so my idea for a session on BitFrost at BCMilw2 didn't get much interest. I'll throw up some new ideas today to see what people think.
Wireless optical mouse failed so I dug out a Kensington 7-button trackball mouse, and it's awesome. Yes, it's USB.
Looking at my calendar, I've got a few months solid of stuff like Web414, BarCamp Milw2, and the Adobe AIR Tour scheduled. Nice.
Speaking of which, they need to start making GPS-enabled cameras. Preferrably something like the Canon Powershot G9 with GPS. heh.
Why do people geo-tag their photos of their kids? I mean, sure, you took that picture in Madison, but I wanted pics of the city, not babies.
Back from a walk (followed by a ride in the car down to Illinois state line, oddly) Trying to figure out the evening.
It's my birthday, which means I'm 21. Now I'm old enough to sneer at people younger than me for being so clueless and inexperienced.
Watching a really big, nasty looking spider hunt moths and flies on my screen door.
Twitter = exponential txt messaging growth. The cell carriers must love it.
Just bought the new William Gibson novel, Spook Country. Going to sit down to read it and not getting up until I'm finished.
All bit up from mosquitos.
@ashleydryden gah, I forgot to order Moo cards. I'll have to wait until I've got money again - just paid for books and tuition :/
Just got home. Oh man, all three new iPods look awesome.
@v3rt1g0 100+ had just sort of burned into my mind as how many posts any given folder or All Items should have. Not any more!
@v3rt1g0 sorry, that last part slipped in because I think the RDF is still active.
@ashleydryden @v3rt1g0 Yeah. plus then they can autoplay hymns when you visit the myspace profile and have top friends of Jesus & Steve Jobs
Playing with an old apple newton emate (the laptop-formfactor one) and thinkg about using it for notes at school if I rebuild the battery
15 minutes of flash video should not take an hour to load. My brain hurts from the waiting.
Slow night on twitter and my bandwidth is totally not loading this thing. Suckage.
Net connection is sooooo slow today/night. :/
"Snitter is a village and civil parish in Northumberland, England. It is in the Alnwick district.." Thanks Wikipedia!
@blissdev @ashleydryden snitter? Pownce is where it's at w/ AIR apps (even though I'm saying this on twitter, heh)
doh, I never put a microformats session on bcMilw2 site. My fault. @ashleydryden intro to microformats or will it be a more adv. session?
Just caught up with an old friend from my IRC glory days (1998-2004ish)
Err, ran out of space there. Point being, mobile devices are creating the need for better displays, not TVs or desktops.
Here's a thought: Monitors on your desktop/laptop aren't get better DPI, but mobile devices like the iPhone&iPodTouch are pushing 200+ dpi.
Tell Tom from MySpace to leave me alone. I don't want his private messages.
Wish my WAP/DSL modem had a console I could log into and run tcpdump or the like. Something's fishy w/ the ISP and my bittorrent traffic.
Waiting for my night class to start
Happy Hardcore (as in Techno) is not my thing, it turns out. :/
Although in teh past when we distributed files on hdds and CD-Rs we called it Sneaker-Net.
Mix flash drive swap for lower cost and higher music-density;.
Random thought: RSS readers today are the modern Usenet. Discuss.
@Scobleizer Gah, sorry, tense and stuff gets messed up in 140 chars. Was asking which comes first to demand the other.
@Scobleizer Will we (consumers, programmers) have more parallel software (threads etc) 1st for manycore CPUs, or will hardware deliver 1st?
Is there no RSS or Atom feed for tantek.com or am I hallucinating? (There's an Atom validator, but that doesn't help...)
Unsure.
Plus you're likely to pull wires for power windows/locks and/or set off the burglar alarm rather than hook a (nowadays shielded) lock bolt
*look very suspicious
@blissdev you could try a coat hanger, but that's highly unlikely to work and will love very suspicious
@blissdev You'll get ripped off calling a locksmith. Got a shady uncle or friend who might own a slim jim?
Trying to catch up with feeds before I do some h/w. (& then some work for $ would be good, but unlikely) Not enough hours in the day :(
Sadly don't think they'll be able to add a microphone to the itouch without hardware hacking, so I'll probably end up with an iPhone soon.
Have they hacked Skype onto the iphone yet?
@raster @ashleydryden Apple Newtons for everyone in 1998 was a far less succesful program
Thought: Gone are the days of spraypaint advertising (companies spray ads at you and hoped they stick) It's a discussion now. Discuss plz.
im in yur twitterz, postin' my dietary habits:     
@ashleydryden thought that was a direct message at me for a moment. whew.
in class even.
Will be in call all tonight so can't make the #web414 meeting
I estimate I have 559 linear-years of flash video of things I want to watch in my feed reader, including Scoble and Google Tech Talks. Nice.
Cool stuff from BarCamp Cambridge: 
Saw a post on a Facebook event wall with a userpic that I used to use (from an anime) thought I had posted it for a sec. Freaky-strangeness.
Nice that gas just dropped 5 cents and I filled up yesterday.
grah that was messed up. sorry, ignore that thought! :)
Ideal firefox behavior: donewly created tabs (apple-click) and if I hold down Cmd don't select it (so I can open m
dear twitter: shopping for groceries and cooking is boring. Need suggestions plz (prefer vegetarian stuff), kthnxbai.
Bored @ lunch. Also wish i had an iphone right now
awake, but not alive yet. *zombie noises*
It's kind of weird to go back to a wireless regular-mouse after using a trackball for two weeks or so.
Done with classes for the day. Study then go home.
Actually it doesn't really make sense. Co-working is much cooler.
I'm inventing co-studying for college students. Right now.
@ashleydryden also 
@ashleydryden see my comment on yur site for new info I found
@ashleydryden re: onAIR Am I getting an email? :) my inbox is lonely.
Can't sleep or the grues will eat me. :/
My old iPod (20gig photo) is making clicking noises. I think it's dying..  "Not like this. Not like this."
beer minireview: new glarus dancing man wheat. good stuff.
Listening to the last.fm personal radio station of Kevin Rose. Don't ask me why, although it does have good music.
Latest blog post from Tim Ferris, author of the 4hr workweek, on why its good to be a jack of all trades: 
Considering celebrating Google's 10th birthday tonight. Mainly because it's an excuse to celebrate.
"Why is my microwave giving me a 404 error.. oh wait.. that's the time." - My thoughts a minute ago.
eating a  burrito as a late lunch & made myself a shot of espresso. way more tired than I should be..
gah. Need to get going, already a little late from sleeping in. nice.
@ashleydryden They were out of Spotted Cow, but all the New Glarus stuff is on sale here. Also disclaimer: I am not a beer expert.
beer minireview: new glarus fat squirrel. not really a fan of it. not really that nutty. technically a brown ale I guess.
Done with the night class. Was kind of cool since we talked about PDP-11's afterwards. (read ancient minicomputerS)
Need suggestions for addictive flash games and other time wasters.
Off to do things around town.
cooking some warm food because it's cold outside and I don't feel good.
Really need to go out and do stuff today, but I'm so good at procrastinating.
I could use a couple days of rest. Caught a cold or something :(
life is wonderful. just thought I'd throw that out there.
@v3rt1g0 I'd love to have an opensourced photo uploadr that worked with multiple services, but theres no Cocoa ver and I'm not running Gnome
@v3rt1g0 no zooomr support? I guess being stable would help zooomr get more upload-clients.
Since when did I become the DJ for all the Friday-night parties in my building? I guess I do have the best stereo though.
Disappointed that Amazon doesn't sell Arduino boards. Need to figure out what to spend my birthday giftcards on (too busy to read more books
@v3rt1g0 obviously a wide ranging topic, but a few ideas: unlocking your iPhone, hacking wifi APs like the WRT, heh even LED throwies. dunno
Is BarcampMilw2 lacking for sessions on hardware or just not something many are interested in?
Funny how just about every non-Apple app I open on my mac now pops up informs me it has an update & to go to their site. Need auto updates.
@ashleydryden if I wasn't poor I'd spend a lot more time/$ at teavana and ordering tea online, yeah. heh.
trying a new tea concoction I read about: brew green tea weakly with honey in the cup, sprinkle in cinnamon, then add milk. Cold/froth milk?
Adding a bunch of new feeds to Google Reader. Then after a few weeks I'll look at the metrics and choose which ones to keep and which2remove
Reading up on OAuth. Interesting stuff.
@v3rt1g0 When you guys do a Linux InstallFest, is there time to muck with hardware that's a little hard to install an OS on? (Cobalt Qube3)
and now hdd exhibiting dead behavior again. i give up for the day.
@blissdev yes my linux box is populated by wood elves.
I think something happened on Linux that I'm not actually aware of, where it fixed whatever was borked with the HFS+ volume, so now it works
haha, im in yur borken hdds, cp'ing off the filez befor it diez
why my neighbors probably think I'm weird: hearing me shouting "who do I have to tail -f around here to get this to work?!" on a Sunday aftn
exhausted all ways of trying to recover this external hdd (including sticking ide drive it in linux machine)
Google Reader may keep your entire feed history for you, but it also automatically sets items read after a certain date. I do not want this.
Taking a cue from nature, the next gen Roomba could lay down a "pheremone trail" of febreeze to tell where its already been, like an ant.
Laundry + reading + listening to podcasts. I need a lolcats pic that sez "ssh, plz dun bother, i iz multitasking"
Google Reader "Next&gt;&gt;" bookmarklet is changing how I read feeds, since it loads the actual article. Interesting.
Kevron's concert photos showed up in my Google Reader via a Flickr "Madison" geotag feed. Niec!
making espresso with some of the coffee I got myself for my birthday; its got guarana and yerba mate in it. yay.
@v3rt1g0 I recommend SuperB complex in addition to VitaminC, drinking green tea and eating some minestrone soup (chckn nodl 4you carnivores)
mmm honey on toast
Google Maps does not take advantage of the fact that you're logged into Gmail when you want to send maps/directions. Google, plz fix ktnxbai
@ashleydryden yeah, also something like this appears in ASCII-encoded binary in the book Microserfs as filler. heh.
I must computer faster than my enemy who is trying to PWN me. I must outcompute him before he outcomputes me.
This is my computer. There are many like, but this one is mine. My computer is my best friend. It is my life. I must use my computer true.
Killing time before class.
Strooong espresso I made for a little pick-me-up.
@raster if there are more weekend prep for bcmilw2 i'll try to come up & help. Keep me updated. Also hooray 4 twittering in class! :)
Anyone else clicking through to see photos in Flickr so that they can see the Additional Information/what digital camera took the picture?
Tired enough to sleep. I think I shall.
@ashleydryden omg spoilz
Getting ready to watch Diggnation.
There was an RFID sticker on a bottle of facewash I bought at Walgreens today. Interesting.
Just got good news via email. Feeling really awesome right now.
I'm enjoying reading these well-written stories, not sure if they are fiction or not: 
@blissdev MathiasDGauger
@blissdev last.fm friendzed
@blissdev 200+ graphs in the queue before mine
Also backing up said address book data to a web service would be nice, I'm not aware of anything that does that though beyond webmail stuff
@ashleydryden AIR-version of Addressbook that generates hCards+vCards and looks good? I need one of those..
Ever regret voting for Kerry when you see what a clueless politician he is? (w/ no spine to stop violence, I might add) Me too.
likes: making coffee. dislikes: grinding coffee beans in my magic bullet (read as "spastic noisy bullet")
survived a foreign language test. brain fried for the rest of the day, despite the fact that I'll be in the EE lab for 4-5 hours tonight.
But maybe I was reading O'Reilly Radar back then because I already owned so many OReilly books, was a pre-existing condition of nerd-hackery
@raster Waited for one to show up around here after reading about foo camp years ago and wanting very badly to go.
In the spring I tried to pitch BC Madison to the CSCI faculty and they REALLY didn't get it, they told me they already went to SIGGRAPH...
@raster Yeah, was pulling up from twitter after class and explaining how it works.
Don't think my pitch for BC Milw2 went over so well to students/professor after my night CSCI class. Got the "thanks, but no thanks" feeling
Also Firefox doesn't want to open teh sVG for me as anything other than text, and not in the mood to figure out why.

@blissdev grr, I don't have that. Will look at mine later when I feel like booting into another OS or another box or something.
@blissdev I opened it in several apps. TextMate is the only thing that can open SVG but that isn't helpful.
@blissdev Bigger lines or smaller, though?
... It's an empty PDF.
Got my LastGraph.
Done with my night class. Nice when I get out by 10PM.
Will be bringing an Arduino and maybe an OOPic board + sensors to #BarCampMilwaukee2. Let me know if you're interested or bringing stuff too
Needing more coffee.
Home & listening to some music. Oh right, pirate day, uhh... ARRRRRRRRRR.
Arr, I be twittering during a raid on ye campus starbucks for coffee and booty. I vainquished some fruit earlier to keep off the scurvey.
Avast, set caffienation for full speed ahead!
Wish I was going to the Future of Web Apps conference, if for no other reason to get away from school and see London.
Getting Tweets from Scobelizer all out of order and random-like.
@blissdev Oops, twitteriffic doesn't get the @N24 was part of the URL, strip that off, go to Flickr, add it back to URL.
Nice lastgraph on flickr: 
Just realized I only did a short graph. Queued up a graph of my entire Last.fm history. zomgz.
oh cool. thanks @blissdev :D
3 seconds at home before I run out again. My life is too busy. Also, I need more coffee.
Coffee, punk music, and catching up on some reading before I jet.
feed fatigued. also tired from classes I guess. need sleep now, knthxbai.
How does Twitter work? With magic, I guess: 
It is funny to come across a blog post or news article referencing the "Internet dark ages" because they were only a few years ago. Heh.
Too many tabs open. Need to "process to zero" my Firefox tabs right now.
Trying on a jacket. Is baggy cool now or something? this is a "small"...
This hotel room is supposed to have wifi but my powerbook cant connect. Reason #512 why i need a new laptop
@raster What did you mean by 'microformats module in Drupal could use some work'? I'm curious now. Feel free to email if long answer :)
Coding stuffs.
twee pop + tea + sunny morning  makes me happy. that is all.
caffiene plz kthnxbai
@chiefmonkey congrats on the iphone.. just happen to be reading some of your case notes right now :D
Nevermind, all the posts in my feed reader are because @Scobleizer seems to have gone on a feed binge today.
Wow, over 300 new posts in my feed reader today and I'm just now getting around to it. Did Apple release some new hardware or something? :)
Fog, thick foggy fog. Can't see a car with its headlights on over 50 feet away, I'd say.
Kevin Rose deleted his last.fm account when everyone found it. No more last.fm user radio station from him.
If we lose the netneutrality debate and the Internet becomes cable-style tiered pricing, I'm quitting the intertoobs. That should scare them
Need to sleep now though, heh.
Going to have to step up my productivity starting next week.. school + preparing for onAIR & Barcamp Milw2 +secret project w/ lots of coding
Wondering how semantic data from physical computing (embed microprocessors + sensors all over the real world & network) would get marked up.
Considering devices that could replace my low-watt Cobalt Qube server (which is still a 2.2 kernel).. maybe AppleTV or an older macmini. hm
@v3rt1g0 we will have to talk about Linux some at bcMilw2 I think. :D
also, it's had ubuntu for the past 3 or so years, but I've been mainly using macs that whole time. :D
@v3rt1g0 Might wipe and reinstall a newerish distro on my PC. Not sure I want to go back to sourcebased (used gentoo4+yrs). please advise :)
Way too many feeds to read. Where did these all come from, again? :&gt;
Apparently it's now illegal to bring any home made hardware to the airport, because airport security are stupid: 
@ashleydryden any updates on plans for the onAIR Chicago trip?
Configuring fluxbox to be the wm for a system that only runs 800x600. hmm.
Needs a haircut.
Anyone have links to people who have done the math to figure out costs of traditional hosting versus putting your site up on AmaznEC and S3?
So angry at evil publisher because their CD won't eject from the slotload DVD drive in my macmini. It's a conspiracy.
Defeating the bookstore-publisher monopoly by burning 20 copies of the required listening for a Jazz Appreciation class for free for people.
Sunny morning with coffee. Ideal.
Stopped following @Scobleizer. Dunno what's up tonight w/ him, but his stuff is out of order/cut off, basically sounds like drunken rant..
tonight's beer minireview: sam adams cherry wheat. Nice cherry flavor, not a lot of wheat, but that's okay because it tastes fine. b+
(slowly) reading a review in German of a laptop I'm been thinking about. Hooray for language skills.
watching diggnation + drinking beers. hooray.
OLPC now has a "Give 1 Get 1" program for $400 (the other laptop goes to a child in a developing nation). I'm still looking at the AsusEeePC
New battery pack for Newton emate is now complete. It's charging. w00t.
Playing with Arduino. rah.
Fairly common to see UW students playing disc golf. But only at uwp.edu do you see a guy pushing a stroller while playing disc golf...
Got chewed out today. confidence-- \n have to finish some stuff for a class tonight right now..
Was raining like crazy for a few minutes there. Had to park my car.
S5 appeals to me b/c: how many times I've been to a lecture/presentation and the laptop dies, or the machine they have 2use doesn't have ppt
@ashleydryden The benefit of S5 is you can stick it on your website after the conf, and run it off anything with a browser should you needto
@ashleydryden there's S5, but it's not a WYSIWYG presentation-maker.
Installing some stuff. w00t.
@ashleydryden My tumblr tumblog has been around for awhile, but right now it just echos my twitters, which isn't very useful.
@ashleydryden in my experience both the brand and in general. also cranberry juices tend to be concentrated and need water. maybe its just m
@ashleydryden add water. most pom juice is concentrated and needs to be watered down.
Newton finally done charging. New battery is 4-5x as many milliAmps as the old one, so should have crazy long 'on' time, esp. w/o backlight.
I wish Google Reader knew that I have read stories when they show up in a 2nd time in Robert Scoble's linkfeed. Need less work not more.
@blissdev they sell the CD alone in the bookstore for $15! It's just 99 tracks of instrument samples and little Jazz riffs..
Burning more copies of a required listening CD for a class to give to people for free. Fight the man!
Couldn't explain to my mom on the phone why on earth I'd need a new computer (in this case, a new laptop) but I guess it's a geek thing.
Back from night class. Newton still not fully charged.
Making Minute Rice correctly is harder than it seems. Also, it's not really Minute Rice unless you use a microwave & then its uncooked/soggy
Really, the whole building doesn't have to shake on the subsonic freq range to get that whole "I'm in a rocket" feeling, does it?
Just got home and wondering why my neighbor thinks that the Astronaut Farmer of all movies is a good reason to crank up/test his subwoofers.
Why does the BCMilw2 site initially have a red box for required content (w/ red font) that fades to white font on white background, hrm.
Live from the Adobe OnAIR session webcam: prankses in powerpoint.
Twitteriffic feature request: when I focus on Twitteriffic and hit enter (with nothing in the text field) do a Refresh for new Tweets. kthnx
Attn: OnAIR Chicago peeps. Weather for the weekend should be in the range of 50-75f. Dress warm if this is cold weather for you. kthnxbai.
Wishing I had a laptop that held a charge. :/
@ashleydryden pass :P
also last time I rode the train my friend got motion sick, so I'll be bringing the dramamine. just picked some up today, heh.
@ashleydryden btw train ride is like 1-2 hours. Should we do microformats session planning? :) altho I may not know nearly as much as you.
@heygabe but it only lets you aggregate podcasts that are in the iTunes Music Store Podcast section.
Watching the OnAIR webcam (really listening to it in the background) to get some knowledge before Chicago.
Who ever thought it was a good idea for the campus coffee shop to stop accepting credit cards?
It's funny when laptop manufacturers say a machine is "thin and light" and it's a 15" monster or "featherweight" and it's over five pounds.
"We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place... Our Great War's a spiritual war. Our Great Depression is our lives."
despite lack of caffiene and exhausting day not very sleepy. hrmph.
Finished reading a book. Now to catch up on some coding..
@caw They have trouble finding the interwebs. (even though they write on it...)
Having a hard time fitting complex ideas into a single 140 character twitter message.
Roughly 10:30PM and I just got back from my night class. People kept releasing the magic smoke from ICs and ruining the lab experiment.
French press coffee w/ cinnamon to stave off the braindeath before class..
@ashleydryden Just curious, unfortunately no way I can make it up there at any reasonable hour with night classes :/
@ashleydryden how late do you do the coworking thing?&gt;
Getting a headache from things not working when I don't have all the time in the world to fix them. (another night class tonight, hrrr)
@blissdev no backup? I could bring my newly-fixed newton emate, but that'd just be tacky :)
Debating whether hauling dead Powerbook (err, holds no charge rather) to Chicago for Adobe OnAIR or whether to just bring pen and notebook.
@OnAirBusTour Cheesecurds, especially fried cheesecurds, are a Wisconsin delicacy, not Minnesotan.
waking up exhausted and with a late start on the day sucks.
@ashleydryden w00t Bodum french press. I've got the 1 cup model, not the big one.
@ashleydryden Really? my best $20 appliance was a Melitta steam (no pump) espresso machine and best appliance purchase was a magic bullet :)
Just got home. Will try to relax for 5 minutes. heh.
Upgrading Dapper Drake dev box to Edgy. Yeah, I know I'm behind the times. This machine has been in storage for a year though.
Headache is gone thanks to cinnamon+coffee. Going to write some code for an hour or two w/ self-imposed twitter silence.
Invalid XML tattoo. Also, this one is SFW (but the rest of bmeink.com isn't). 
Geek Life tattoo: 
re: outdated geek tattoos. Gothic script "FORTRAN" across your back ftw.
@v3rt1g0 retro gaming tattoos like pacman and mario bros are all the rage right now.
I'll see what I can bring for food to BarCamp Milw2. Maybe something tasty from 
'Watching' layer tennis: 
BarCamp Happy Days?
Yes, the Matthew in today's Penny Arcade is me. It's official.
debating whether to make coffee or tea now that I've restocked my supply of both.
Never fear, I have a coupon for $2 off a box of tazo at piggly wiggly. to the grocerymobile!
I'm out of green tea. Do not panic. Do not panic.
@ashleydryden I can think of far worse fates for the "pix plez" guy than banning him from the internetz.
heh - 
Activity: Search flickr for "barcamp", view as slideshow, sit back and enjoy teh awesomeness (bonus pts: count web celebritiy appearances)
Maybe I should just ask OnAirBusTour directly tomorrow (when they're not busy) since they're following me on twitter. w00t web two-point-ohz
@raster any idea how the Adobe guy is getting from Milwaukee to Chicago? I'm guessing Amtrak?
@raster The train only runs twice that afternoon from a station roughly 20 miles south of me, so if it means we're not late, then yes. heh.
@ashleydryden Can you guys make it to Kenosha by 1PM? Figure one hour drive on 94 from the south side of Milwaukee or the south half of 894.
I did some points-club-fu with the reservation for the hotel in Chicago for OnAIR; hopefully they won't hassle me about it when we check in.
Making maps w/ directions to multiple destinations on Google Maps brings me so much joy.
Trying to give directions to my house via txt message is really hard. Only because I live in a crazy spot that isn't easy to find
It's bad when the only way I can think of to express myself is sending a "i iz havin a bad hair day" lolcats image..
Google Blog Search's feed keeps returning posts I've seen from August or earlier. What gives?
@OnAirBusTour Should we bring you guys some Wisconsin cheesecurds?
Last-minute packing and preparation.
Or as the kids these days say, "imma log"
@ashleydryden @blissdev See you guys tomorrow. Too tired to keep working on stuff tonight.
Refactoring baggage for minimal weight.
Charging things. Downloading things. Packing things.
The best (worst) part about this anime series is that the themesong is the Japanese version of the Rick Roll'd song (same chord progression)
@raster I'd like to ask you some questions about Amazon S3 and EC at #BCMilw2 (not sure if you're using EC or not but I remember you use S3)
Watching some anime w/ way too small subtitles to read from across the room. Also, Ubuntu box predicts this upgrade will take 7 years or so.
Dreaded headache has returned again. Blaming some sort of 24 hour cold that strangely doesn't cause the sniffles.
@ashleydryden I should do that, too.
Shooting zombies in a flash game.
Trying out the first portabello burger.
Installing Adobe AIR stuff from the CD I got at the Chicago event.
Going to attempt some portabello mushroom burgers tonight
Gah, @atomicfork rather.
@woober Anything you've got is probably better than the grainy/blurry cameraphone pics on Flickr right now.
Charging my phone. Luckily it can survive a few days without charging as long as I don't talk hours and hours on it.
Back home safely in lovely Kenosha WI btw. Gonna watch Diggnation once it downloads :)
No photos from the Chicago OnAIR event last night on Flickr yet. I forgot to take any photos, so I'm hoping a few other people got some pics
Awake after the somehow managing to sleep on teh floor next to the AC. Yes it was cold.
I fall into the "Javascript/HTML developer" category I guess, since I've never used Flex. This session makes much more sense.
Does Chicago keep all its buildings at 60 degrees year round? Been cold everywhere inside here today.
Master Chief helmet sez, "Mike Chambers, I am your father." on stage.
At OnAIR event in Chicago.
Finally getting around to watching this week's diggnation.
Dinner is a bag of steamed vegetables in some brown minute rice, seasoned with lawry's seasoned salt. Yeah, I'm a little broke right now,heh
Taking my laptop to class tonight (+ the little oreilly book) to secretly work on AIR stuff during the boring parts of the lecture.
@ashleydryden I forgot some of the guys on stage were using Aptana to write flex (is the lang called actionscript?) so no flexbuilder needed
(addendum to last twitter: software+design companies)
Anyone have a link to something along the lines of naming conventions/rules for coming up with new company names?
I don't like domain squatters. So many cool domains, but yet so much money to buy them from people I'd rather not give money to.
I guess I needed to realize that just because AIR apps are easier to create than native apps, doesn't mean that I can make them look better.
Having a cup of Starbucks Breakfast blend. Drinking coffee makes me feel more productive. Actually it probably doesn't help at all.
@raster I wish I didn't have to use Flex Builder + Flash(builder or whatever it is called) to use Flash in an AIR app. Javascript/HTML ftw.
Feeling terribly behind despite getting one class cancelled today.
Interesting.. Buzzword, the AIR-based word processor that was demo'd at OnAIR Bus Tour events, got bought up by Adobe.
totally recharged after this weekend. probably because of this weekend.
@ashleydryden I will bring a case of diet Rockstar (my energy drink of choice) and some tea. Do we have water-heating-capabilities?
@raster preferrably. also blinkenlights, glowlights, or POV LED thingies.
@ashleydryden vote for my all-night coding session (or one of the other late-night code sessions) and we'll try it @BarcampMilwaukee
@ashleydryden w00t, Code Raving sounds awesome.
Anyone know a hosting place like ASO that is in Chicago or Milwaukee (more local)?
15 minute power nap (w/ caffiene before, thanks lifehacker) accomplished. day not looking so stressful now.
@blissdev I've always thought about going with asmallorange.com ; they have service levels that are more my size. (small or medium service)
@blissdev mediatemple is expensive. do you use the grid service?
Have to run back to school early before night class to help someone with their lab. My day has justbeengoing GREAT after the 2am fire alarm.
@raster re: Flex SDKs. The Adobe commandline tools can do that and Adobe is distributing them free, dunno about open source though.
@raster both of those events can be captured afaik, the developer just needs to code them in.
Great. Fire alarm is going off in the building and there doesn't seem to be a fire. It's very loud and I was trying to sleep .wtf.
Reading the little green O'Reilly AIR book we got in Chicago, despite 3 New Glarus Spotted Cows and needing to sleep at some point tonight.
The gadget on sale at woot.com right now is exactly what we needed on the train this weekend to watch Diggnation on @ashleydryden's laptop.
@atomicfork Adobe has recruited an army of enthusiastic people willing to build cool AIR apps no matter what, it seems.
Sony, Hitachi & others are in a race for the thinnest LCD HDTVs. Good news for me, because regular LCDs should get cheaper & I'm not picky.
Funny how I can't find a link to format for print on this Wordpress blog. Are Wordpress blogs all missing this?
Keep getting told by friends who don't use Twitter much that I makefar too many tweets. They should see @ashleydryden go on her cellphone ;)
Where did 400 new posts in Google Reader come from? On a Monday? ugh. Too busy, will have to "process to zero" this weekend.
Decided that I'm *not* this kid: 
Fog thicker than I've ever seen down here. Just got home from my night class (Unix Sysadministration) talked to the prof about OnAIR & OLPCs
Personal unit tests (exercise, GTD, chores, etc as unit tests). Cool idea: 
Link to Awesome Video. I build guitarfx+amps & I so want to build one of these: 
BarCamp Milwaukee2 sessions are looking great. Can't wait to go; hopefully I can attend all of them!
Just got home. Grabbing the latest Totally Rad Show & will commence drinking mucho coffee and taking painkillers now.
@ashleydryden Hope you're okay. Limping to class now.
@ashleydryden if they set off the fire alarm tonight, fire or no, I'm staying in bed. screw that $#17.
@blissdev torn ligaments, but I'm walking on it. No painkillers. Still really hurts. That's about all the updates for tonight. need sleep
The day from hell continues: I dislocated a bone in my knee from stepping funny on the way back to my car from class in the dark.
Home again. Getting up to speed with today via Google Reader.
Total power outage on campus. Only exitsigns are on & some fire/riotproof doors have locked down.
sleep. need. eh, something like that. too tired to form complete sentences.
Powerbook gets an OnAIR Bus Tour sticker. Now what else should get a sticker?
Wow, I just launched Pownce's AIR client and its majorly broken-looking. Beta 2.0 issues?
I guess I'll watch the Hotel Chevalier short because everyone else already saw it. Also, have to watch the last episode of The IT Crowd.
@ashleydryden Not quite liking it. I mean.. do not want.
Too tired for doing anything but watching TRS and dreaming about AIR apps right now.
off to night class.
@blissdev we've always been at war with oceania.
@blissdev we
@raster actually, with what I've got on hand, I decided to do sprint pasta: less than 10 mins to make pasta, heat sauce, veggies&garlocbread
Trying to decide what's for dinner.
Inspired by that guy who had his Personal Unit Tests hosted on Backpack, I'm writing up my own that includes focus on H/W & studying for Uni
What's the odds I 'splode from all the caffiene it takes to get me through the day lately? Very likely.
Drinking a pomegranate+green tea soda, listening to Last.fm recommends player, and coding+learning to do stuff with SQLite & Adobe AIR
@raster no macbook for me?
roomba is in attack mode. it snagged itself on a pair of my sneakers and started dragging them around.
@ashleydryden making dinner right now
@ashleydryden heh, maybe I should have come after all.
@ashleydryden You guys would be leaving by the time I got there :)
Trying out svnX
Anyone used monkeywrenchhosting.com ?
Using Google Reader to divine from the tea leaves if ASUS will release this new laptop this month or not..
Funny how I tune out SXSW podcasts in teh background when they do boring stuff and my ears perk up when they start being interesting again.
@ashleydryden @blissdev added to proposed session list on barcampmilwaukee.com
@ashleydryden Sunday morning session at #BCMilw2?
@blissdev that's how I killed 3 so far. Hard drives don't like to move. Go for flash storage for portable drive?
@blissdev Seagate Free Agent looks nice if you never plan to move it (ie not portable drive)
Debating buying an ext. HDD today or eating next week. Choices.
Making a double shot of espresso to wake up neurons.
back home, just in time for Layer Tennis.
One more cup of tea before I go to class, then I'm going to watch Layer Tennis all afternoon and work on presentation for #BCMilw2
Just found the OkSocial.org button from @ashleydryden (thanks!) dunno where to put it.
ah, looks great in Safari. of course.
just found  screenshots I've seen look awesome,but my firefox doesn't have the right font or smth so it looks b0rkd. hrm.
@raster got rid of the main heat source, the freaking processor(s)?
Just did my first round of morning "Personal Unit Tests." Didn't do so well; I guess I need improvement.
New twitter UI issue: If I click follow, there's no response to what I just did, other than a tiny spinning wheel. Need instant feedback!
0wn3d 
lil' mac mini is running out of hdd space. need to save for an external again and hope it doesn't die.
He's looking at a 3.0 Core 2 Duo system, 4gigs of RAM, either 8600GT or dual 7900GS gfx cards, Raptor X boot/os hdd + Seagate data hdd. w00t
Giving a professor hardware recommendations for building a gaming box. Heh.
@ashleydryden w00t.
Can I selectively turn off Facebook emails so it doesn't tell me about things a certain person does?
Back home.
Twitteriffic feature request: either let me choose in Options to show twitter username or show both real name and username 4 easier @replies
Mmm, green tea + blueberry + strawberry + OJ smoothie.
Apartment keeps getting unbearably hot, and AC can't keep it cool.
Sell the apps through wifi iTunes music store as well as offer them free thru iTunes like podcasts. Maybe even track updates to apps via RSS
Apple could do OSX's Dashboard for the iPhone:Javascript/HTML/Flash offline apps. Since they use Flash/WebKit, go w/Adb AIR 1.0 signed apps.
Funny how we now look for security holes (developers are searching for a buffer overflow on the iPhone/iPod touch) to install our own apps.
Getting a bunch of fwd'd chain email from family. wtf.
note: banging on keyboard randomly will not make code work.
Watching Merlin Mann's Inbox Zero presentation video again for inspiration.
Working on a presentation (in S5) about Microformats (yes, the presentation is marked-up) for @BarcampMilwaukee / #BCMilw2
Back on twitter. yay.
wondering if I should just down a couple rockstar energy drinks and stay up all night coding.
Making dinner: zatarain's beans and rice and some veggies on the side. More green tea to wake me up; I'm on a caffiene binge this weekend
@ashleydryden *shruggers*
@ashleydryden are you watching that chuck-the-geek-secret-agent show?
dinner complete. Read a few feeds, study a bit, then I can watch diggnation.
banging my head against Eclipse again. Let me just say, I dont like it. Give me commandline tools and vi or Textmate (depending on platform)
hacking on code in Eclipse for the bug labs beta..
Fighting with Eclipse on every platform I use it on (Mac OSX, WindowsXP, and Linux) Surprisingly it finds different errors/crashes for each.
Haven't watched it all yet, but so far this Google Tech Talk video is great: 
bash, curl, grep, cut, and xargs. Helping me automate tasks since forever.
Looking forward to learning stuff on the #BCMilw2 photowalk. Realized most of my photos posted on flickr or z000mr aren't very interesting.
Trying to use Facebook to coordinate plans to go see The Darjeeling Limited in Highland Park (Chicago) tonight.
It's a watch-videos-on-the-web kind of day.
Green tea and sunshine.
This hallway conversation bores me. Sorry.
"Setting up bicyclerepair.. \n Saving custom dances.." sometimes Linux is weird.
Debating whether to watch the new episode of Diggnation now or tomorrow.
Loving that Firefox looks out for me by underlining my spelling mistakes. We're a good team.
Blasting the Blues Brothers album. Because I can.
beer minireview: new glarus staghorn octoberfest bier. tasty, not too 'hopsy' for me. smooth going down, too (no harsh aftertaste)
Queues up a bunch of comments on barcampmilwaukee.com for @raster / the other admin there to approve.
@ashleydryden AIR's Talisman and Muse's Knights of Cydonia? At least those would be my debugging-themesongs.
Forgot cheese at the store. oh well.
Running out to get caffiene and food so I can code all night. Also should buy beer for watching Diggnation tomorrow.
Upgrading Linux box from Edgy to Feisty. Yes, it just got upgraded to Edgy last week. I'm behind the times.
Now if they'd just hurray up and release the thing before I'm broke again.
Plan: eeePC laptop: $400. 1 gig of ram for it: $30. 4 gig SD Card for it: $30. Low cost, ultraportable computing in your hand? Priceless.
lunar-linux.org says it does. Cool. I need a system with those two installed and no other packages mucking it up, so I might go with LL.
@v3rt1g0 Does Lunar Linux have Eclipse Europa 3.3 and stub packages of some sort for Java 1.6? (or at least doesn't ship with GCJ?)
knee exercises from doctor + simplefit.org workout + post-exercise stretch found on lifehacker.org = relaxation
@raster @v3rt @ashe There's gotta be a Yogi Berra quote that is fits inthis discussion, like "it takes a long time to count to infinity"
@ashleydryden I don't have unlimited texts, thats what I only send twitters from my phone, not receive.
home again.
@ashleydryden taking photos of myself is so myspacey. Btw, anyone know a photoshp tut for blurring photo bg so it looks like it was take ...
Saw this sign: "stress management has moved to tallent hall" which is about five minute walk across campus(walk through the prairie)
I look like im auditioning for Across the Universe today w/ my Beatles HELP tshirt, bellbottoms, shaggy hair, & newsie cap
I loved Kids in the Hall back in teh day: 
Backpack reminders sent to my gmail account don't actually work.
@v3rt1g0 excellent! party time!
@raster you're the 1% that shows up on netcraft  for Mac G3 processor/Firefox 1.0.x
home from class. eating a bean burrito & trinken some green tea.
Off to watch a movie in Jazz History class.
Running behind, as usual.
I wonder if people are going to be declaring 'Twitter bankruptcy' in 6 months, and Merlin Mann will have to teach us all to twitter to zero.
German darkwave (goths playing orchestrated industrial rock while dressed like Renaissance corpses.) Thanks last.fm, this is awesome.
in theory, the last.fm tag "coding" should give me nice tunes to listen to coding. In practice, it's everything from 80s Rap to deathmetal..
This new hat is my coding hat. It grants +1 Int and +1 against Reflex saving throws for Compile Errors.
moving around big files
done at the lab. heading home.
@v3rt1g0 maybe too late, but there are quite a few 'open' wifi ap's on fon.com ... then again most of them are set up as pay-only gateways
in the csci lab writing shell scripts.
On second thought, wish I had a (hacked) iPhone.
@ashleydryden @blissdev @atomicfork @videovillian Wishing I could use the "It's okay, I have an iPhone" excuse for not turning in lab report
Downing a Rockstar diet because it is gonna be a loooong class tonight.
May have overdone the protein in this Thai noodle thing I made: 1 egg, some Morningstar fake-ground-meat, and sautéed peanuts. Tasty though.
@blissdev @v3rt1g0 Jaiku, Gmail, Google Docs & YouTube all running on the gPhone, as long as hardware has QWERTY keyboard = will be awesome.
@ashleydryden Google's 'cloud' could probably help Twitter stability, but I like twitter as neutral infrastructure from a startup not a corp
Google buys Jaiku? I'm glad Twitter is staying indie (do startups 'sell out' when they get bought up like bands who sign to labels?)
Decided to buy Radiohead's new album online, and can't get the site to load. Is it working for anyone else? 
@ashleydryden I don't keep anything on it anyways. It just has to work on Sat & Sun
Battery on my powerbook is now showing 0 mAh of Full Charge Capacity and Negative current in About this Mac. Nice.
home from uwp.edu ... need to get an oil change I think.
@raster I thought Apple doesn't make the iSight anymore?
@raster Hopefully we will. I don't really know how these 'confs talking to confs' thing ever worked, I've heard it planned but never impleme
#BCMilw2 we should somehow get in touch with  (Ontario Linux Fest) as their event is on the 13th (Sat) as well.
BarcampMilwaukee.com looks pretty fugly on this linux box with the default X11 fonts.
@raster I lived in the Upper Peninsula much longer than I've lived in WI. I'm used to the cold, but not abrupt changes like this.
Too cold outside. Plz fix
Need coffee plz. kthnxbai.
Wish I had the time to watch all the hour or longer videos of Google Tech Talks on video.google.com ; there's some neat stuff in there!
home from the lab / night class.
Waiting for the lab to get unlocked
Off to night class to discuss integrated circuits, digital logic, and designing CPUs. Wish me luck, heh.
@philcrissman Sadly that doesn't work on Mac version of Firefox
Spend a minute each day to remind yourself what you're grateful for. It works wonders.
@raster walls are brick, so I don't actually hear anything except for the bass, but he's got it loud enough to rock the foundation & such
If my neighbor doesn't turn down his stereo I will gladly construct a makeshift EMP device to do it for him.
Home from class. At least until tonight's night class. Out of milk so I'm drinking espresso straight up.
Need to get going soon. Cancelled morning classes are nice, though.
@raster I might have to pull a session on something with a three-line title then.
gah, too tired to make proper coffee and breakfast.
@raster I'll be there to watch^H^H^H^H^Hgive you encouragement!
Watching a DVD, preparing for @BarCampMKE w/ @ashleydryden, & having a smoothie. yum yum yum.
@ashleydryden I'm bummed I forgot to take any photos in Chicago, so I'll have my camera out @BarCampMKE
Need to finish watching TRS.
Shutting down all my machines & stuff.
@heygabe doh, I missed out on the sharpie stealing in Madison.
Last-minute packing for @BarCampMKE. Anything I should not forget to bring?
@raster alas, I do not. my megaphone, she has left me.
@heygabe @ashleydryden Backup plan: Pete + Megaphone.
Making zombie noises. Brain functioning at that level right now.
At prev. confs I took notes in text files & never used them again. Trying to decide what to do for notes at @BarCampMKE. Might use Backpack.
Technosailor.com Self-Importance Test says I'm most like Matt Mullenwag (head dev of Wordpress).. interesting. Back to watching DVDs, heh.
Engadget: "Asus introduces trio of new LCD monitors." Oh, joy. I swear ASUS, can you NOT just release the EEEpc already?!
Study for exam, pack, DVD, sleep. Good deal.
Radiohead seems to have fixed their online store at  --&gt; I just bought the album & downloading now.
@ashleydryden Thanks. Just making sure.
Is there a standardized Flickr tag for @BarCampMKE? Maybe we could do like OnAIR Chicago event and put it up during the intro session.
Arrived at barcampmke :)
Leaving germantown for @barcampmke now
@barcampmke peeps: Not going to make it to bucketworks tonight, see you tomorrow morning
@barcampmke redbull run (& other bevs) @front desk right now
@barcampmke redbull run @ 6pm before dinner. meet by the checkin desk.
@barcampmke We are in an old piano factory/repair for photowalking. Its awesome
@barcampke yarr, this be a hearty meal
@barcampmke Session in 140 characters or less plz kthxbye
Im on the wall
My @BarCampMKE photos are uploading to flickr in semi-random fashion. Oh well, these are the ones that turned out okay..
@videovillian looking at flickr photos instead of sleeping. still haven't slept. heh.
Going to go crash for 10-13 hours of sleep now.
@BarCampMKE Just got safely home to Kenosha, WI. Thanks to everyone for an awesome weekend. Drive safe out there, it is wet & slippery!
7:03AM Why are there unicorns the freeway? It's all Pete's fault...
500 unread items in Google Reader from not being online normally most of hte weekend. Do not want.
@barcampMKE the Code Rave is gonna go all night!
@barcampmke I'm rocking the LED throwies on my hat.
@barcampMKE BEST CODE RAVE EVER
getting hushed @barcampmke
@BarCampMKE CODE RAVING STARTING NOW IN #0C0C0C0
@barcampMKE commence code raving and drinking red bull now!!!
@blakehall I propose RESTCamp, where we a) learn from @raster what a RESTful interface actually is, & b) lounge around in beanbags and rest.
While I'm at class tonight I'd like you all to discuss the merits via twitter of an invite-only *camp-like event instead of open to everyone
Am I the only one who sees 'Al' in reference to Al Gore all over the net and think they're congratulating AI as in Artificial Intelligence?
@raster so she's mrs. lord of chaos?
Grabbing a bunch of SXSW session podcasts before I unsubscribe again.
$99 Zune on woot.com is tempting.
720 unread items in Google Reader now. Wondering how long I can neglect it before I no longer care.
oh snap son! my new door sign:  make your own tshirt because I don't support cafepress! :)
Anyone know if the illustrations in pages of Make Magazine are Creative Commons remixable?
@Pete It was broken beforehand, we were trying to figure out if we could circuit bend or anything.
@world I'm the fastest twitterer in the west.
@raster Zac owns it, but he couldn't propagate the DNS quick enough for us to put anything up that night, and then he went to sleep.
@ashleydryden Flickr links break in twitter due to the at-symbol, so I tinyURL'd it for you: 
@raster which is a misspelling of neighborherd.com
@raster neiborherd.com
Considering making a "Make LED Throwies not MK-5s" tshirt stencil with exploded views of an LED throwie and MK-5 on it.
Bronzer dude is back on teh main page of Flickr. Be warned.
Explaining BarCampMilwaukee2 & LED throwies to my lunch study group with help from Flickr.
Going to walk around all day with LED throwies sticking to me.
After offering to work on student org website, got told: "No one will know how to modify CSS after you; someone will always know Frontpage!"
A semi truck just stopped at the stoplight out front blaring a recording of the Star Spangled Banner played on bagpipes. Only in Kenosha.
Green tea, don't fail me now.
I don't think 5AM is a good time to be feeling awake. Time for more sleep, son.
Apparently the flickr Uploadr app doesn't actually apply the tags you give it to your photos. Gotta go tag mine all manually...
Good quote from Marcus Nelson from the Co-working Session: "If I Google "Zac Witte's dad' will it come right up?" heh.
@v3rt1g0 I missed those at barcampmke
Listening to the audio of Clint's Elevator Entertainment Project session.  Awesome session.
Dear MIT.edu, please leave Boston so I may attend your institution. Boston doesn't understand LEDs, much less amy technology beyond 1885.
Rocking: 
Finally home.
Stuck @ someone's house. Watching them browse eBay at a painfully slow pace& trying to be polite. Blah
UNIX Admln midterm in the bag
Too stressed out and behind on everything to find spending 4 hours in the lab tonight a good thing. Considering dropping it despite the fees
My Macmini is unbearably slow lately. Dunno why. It needs a quadcore, maybe. Someone call Largo from Megatokyo!
My neighbor is trying to drive me crazy by cranking his amp while tring to do the same descending bass line for 25 mins & screws up eachtime
@4braham 
If you are a freelancer, indie developer, or a generally person without office in Chicago, north of Chicago, or SE WI please contact me. thx
My phone & its headset are acting up. Very angry about having a PHONE that cant make make phonecalls
hoping to get everything done before deadlines today while juggling classes.
Need more coffee before I can go get stuff done.
@ashleydryden lawlz
Just set up  w/ wordpress theme 4 a professor. I'll get it to validate & add widgets this weekend
Telling me the Singularity wont happen because current tech might be @ a peak is like saying the earth cant be round when the horizon is ...
@BarCampMKE I really dig the text transforming in that BCOrlando video.
"... I keep telling my colleagues how awesome you are, and when you show up to do the website you've got a pink penguin tshirt on."  w00t
Love all the friends requests on various web services that resulted from BarCampMKE2. Not liking that we still havent automated friends reqs
Where exactly are gangster rappers going when they "hops in my ride to make a quick run" anyawys?
Funny how the higher-end GPS units are starting to get close to the specs of lower-end UMPCs and tablets. Soon I may only need a GPS.
Considering signing up for one of those free wiki services and then using the web to have people help fill in my conf schedule for next year
I should note that Kevin Rose predicted these back when the iPhone came out & Alex Albrecht wouldn't believe him: 
Cursing because the ASUSeeePC unboxing photos showing up online from Taiwan make it look good. Going back and forth on whether I'll buy one.
I'm just a Joel Spolsky fanboy that I'm watching the FogBugz demo in Austin live after he announced it on the JoelonSoftware blog. Yeah.
Sometimes Adblock Plus is too aggressive. I didn't even tell it to block all embedded Youtube videosbut it has suddenly decided to do that..
@v3rt1g0 your myspace page is very pimped. cool.
Not ready for primetime yet, but I want to invite all my twitterpeeps to jump onboard this & help me out: 
No rain here yet, but lots and lots of wind. It was hard to hear my podcasts in the park with the gusty wind.
Not the best photo of me, but still funny: 
Warming up some lunch and loading up the iPod with podcasts and the like. Then I'm going to go to the park and catch up on my relaxation.
Made too much coffee. Luckily, this isn't a bad thing.
"Why are there flies in your freaking house?" "It's southern Wisconsin and I have fruit.."
Studying abroad in Europe next Spring means I can probably get an unlocked iPhone there. sweet.
@ashleydryden I might have one in a box somewhere that I never opened. Let me check tonight when I get home.
Just realized that Amazon's package tracker says two packages got delivered to my house but they never came or got stolen. What do I do?
The guy cutting the lawn outside just mowed his tractor right through a hedge because he wasn't looking. He was sending a txt message I gues
Really looking forward to next week's layer tennis w/ Jason Santa Maria, btw.
@tapps that can be arranged
Oh man. Layer Tennis, you make my day. 
Adding more feeds to Google Reader doesn't help my information overload, but I keep telling myself it'll improve my 'perspective' hah
Doing statistical analysis of post counts in this thread: 
Consumerism! The Musical: 
@ashedryden @raster And sadly all the examples are usually static HTML, but they're easy to add to bcreate dynamically in your PHP, RoR etc.
Gotta get some customer support from Amazon. The post office lost one of my packages and charged me $3 in ransom for the other (super saver?
@ashedryden Why do microformats get all the haters? No one complains when M$ products break accessibility.
I'm going to refrain from telling stories that start, "This one time, at BarCamp.."
Flickr needs the "Photos You're In" function that Facebook has. Yes, I'm that interested in seeing myself on Flickr.
Gonna need a haircut this weekend.
@blakehall adding another 4Gb via the SD card slot costs about $30. your call.
&lt;3 
Just sent this in response to a problem on some code: 
The new school of spam: "Claim your Hannah Montana concert gift package participate now" ...
Making super-thick fruit smoothies that will no doubt someday kill the motor in my Magic Bullet, but they taste mmm mmm mmm.
Just realized that the webcam on the Asus EeePC (runs Linux) probably won't work on flash-based lifecasting sites like ustream, seesmic, etc
Gonna link to  again here in the hopes that it gets some love. Surely you guys know a few awesome confs?
@ashedryden my mom got me monogrammed stuff from Landsend, and I guess w/ monograms you put the last letter in the middle, bigger? Yup, MGD.
Considering @ashedryden's move to a shorter twitter username, should I move to something like "mdg" ?
@tapps dunno at this point. I get pretty burned out quickly doing  BAU cubefarm stuff, but don't want to be a freelance web designer/dev atm
Quick job search on all the jobs.* sites out there now (lifehacker, 37signals, joelonsoftware, etc.) tells me I'm going to remain unemplyed.
Running out of bandwidth and HDD space. Would be cool to do all storage & d/ls through S3/EC2 in the future and laptop being a 'thin client'
Feeling unproductive. Might as well play flash games.
Need to pick a web app framework to build a demo of an idea I had. Might pick one I haven't used before, for fun.
oh snap @LayerTennis, son. Glass just got served! (err, volleyed? Pummeled? I don't know tennis lingo)
Downing Starbucks Doubleshots and making script.aculo.us do sexy things to my site.
Just realized that @ss is a person on twitter. Clever.
Not knowing Javascript, it's not as easy to implement stuff with as I thought. In fact, it's kicking my @ss all over.
Trying to 'crowdsource' my 'social grid' on 'Facebook' to find a place to get a 'haircut'. We'll see how that goes.
Sugar-Free Sobe No Fear is my new drink to replace diet Rockstar. Just wish I could get hte Sobe in cases.
Dear eBay motors: Don't let people give a car a headline "like new!" and then the picture shows it has clearly been in a headon accident.
Zatarain's Beans and Rice. yum yum yum yum.
Headlight harness is shorting out somewhere in the engine bay. Not good, although I shouldn't expect wiring from 15 years ago to last.
Going to diagnose problems with the Jeep's electrical system. Headlights are dead, dash lights up, radio+heating/cooling fans all dead.weird
Just signed up for  despite Paypal making the checkout more complicated than it had to be.
The things you'll see on Flickr, the things you'll see...
Up early? I feel fine. Too cold to go outside, but I never was a 'morning runner', or a 'runner' for that matter...
Why am I so lucky? She'll kill me if misinterpret "lucky"... not that. But I don't know what to else to say.
When she removes embarassing photos of us  from Flickr I know I'm in love. &lt;3 Rosy. She has to leave now though. The geese are bleeti ...
Rosy says "lawls": 
Growl on the mac = best thing ever.
@chiefmonkey lol. I always knew cats were evil. This case file might make it official.
How did Google Adsense know to advertise jobs to me? It's psychic now, I think.
I shouldn't be allowed to send email to professors without a breathalyzer. We'll see how things go on Monday now. lol.
Rocking out with Rosy tonight. She's the best!
Iz Caturday sumeware! 
Getting my CrankyGeeks fix.
Mixing vodka with various liquids. Perhaps a new web-mashup with come of this experiment; who knows!
I am a dishwashing MACHINE.
err, unnecessary use of quotes in that last twitter. yay.
Anyone else have problems w/ the laminate top on your desk wearing away where you use the mouse? My desk has a 'white' halo there...
@tapps link?
Just unsubscribed from some feeds. Hoping to make my feed reading a little more sane.
 needs some love. Sorry that it requires registration. plz help me out! kthnxbai.
Wondering whether these photos on Flickr are awesome because they were taken with a Digital SLR, or because of the skill of the photographer
Recommend some interesting twitter-peeps to me to start following. kthnxbai.
@factoryjoe if that isn't evidence of a bubble, I don't know what is.
New diggnation episode should be downloaded in a few minutes. I think I'm gonna go drink-for-drink with Kevin Rose.
We'll get Photo Fight Club going in Milw as soon as I'm mobile again. Two photogrphrs, one night out, 100's of photos & all posted to Flickr

@caw It waas changed to "He ate at your Mom's House" and then reverted back again in the last few seconds.
Considering various ways to disposing of the Jeep if it is dead; mostly involving fireballs and/or jumpramps. Somehow I doubt any are legal.
Catching up on feeds.
We need a "THIS.. IS.. CODE RAVING" video. stat.
@v3rt1g0 we should start our own. I used to MUD like crazy. That and log onto BBSes. Those were the days.
Forget to add some sort of protein to tonight's dinner. Oh well, pasta is tasty no mater which way you cut it.
Gotta get to class.
The Ron Paul supporter websites are using imagery from V for Vendetta now to illustrate their message. Interesting.
@raster I'm gonna go hang out with Val Kilmer, I hear he can fly a jet and builds lasers. And has a sweet treehouse.
@raster @ashedryden Val Kilmer lives in a treehouse: 
Brohemian Rhapsody (w/ Jack Black, I think?) 
This weather does not appeal to me.
@v3rt1g0 that'd make a good passive-aggressive note, print it out with "No seriously, turn that stuff down or I'll send the bunny"
Just got home. Seriously, neighbor is making the whole building rumble with his subwoofers again. I might have to go 'fix' this.
@ashedryden @videovillian don't worry, I'll go put on a rock show to make up for your passing out early. CODE RAVING.
It's not even 1am. Don't tell me you guys are all out now...
there was fire and zombies.
Don't worry. I survived the epic battle.
I think my liver owns stock in Fleischmann's vodka at this point.
I love how 5 minutes of the beginning of Flight of the Navigator is just dogs catching frisbees. So 80's.
Oh snap, son. You're watching Flight of the Navigator! Can you get any more 80's?!
This public service announcement brought to you by the Magic Bullet, Dole frozen fruit, and Fleischman's Vodka.
Still haven't given  anything to do. Feel like a bad boss.
Seesmic has been taken over by Robert Scoble? At least that's how today's (day 15) video update looks.. :/
@raster Are you forming a team for  ? Or do we not get to pick teams?
@ashedryden I misread that as wanting a service where you could send twitter reminders/appts and they'd show up on your gCal.
LEDs from the BCMKE2 LED Throwie session are blinding when attached to a 1.6V 80mA wall-wort. yowzer, it's like a diffuse laser.
Looking up details of the Amazon Startup Challenge.
Hooray for sales on 24 packs of Redbull. I now have sufficient supplies to hold a WI SuperHappyDevHouse event. Just no location.
I just got rick'rolled @ the grocery store
Right, off to Aldi's for German foods, and Woodmans for vegetarian food and energy drinks. Will see if they make sugar-free Gamer Fuel.
@4braham free redbull would rock.
Asus EeePC, OLPC, or Nokia 810? Can't decide.
@ashedryden which one? I'm going to look at the selection at Woodman's; thinking of switching to sugar-free Bawls (but they're so expensive)
I wish Twitter direct messages were threaded. I can't tell what we're talking about in half of them right now due to concurrent conversat:(
Mango Black Tea from Teavana for breakfast, then off to class.
JOVI PUNCH. FULL RECOVERY.
@v3rt1g0 Radiohead is good. I setup the 01+10 playlist (two albums mesh together) and it's bliss. 
Taking the rest of the night off to read Rudy Rucker's newest book. Feeds can wait. :)
Updating my wiki for confs I'll be attending in '08:  Anyone know potential sponsors for my tech-conf tour?
How long can this headache last? At least tonight's class was fun.
Freezing. Might be a cold. This does not bode well.
making some coffee.
Leopard video guy sure waves his hands around a lot in that video.
I can haz lazy sunday alreadys?
MD5 = c1a5298f939e87e8f962a5edfc206918
Need to sit down with a group of cryptographers and discuss whether this idea I've got is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, etc.
I'm asking it as a metaphorical question at this point. I'm just wondering whether it's legally a problem.
Is there obligation against going off and coming up w/ a competing product if I was in a beta program but didn't sign an NDA or non-compete?
It's the assumption that web development is 'programming' now in people's minds, anything else (games, embedded, etc) is the exception.
Interesting sidenote #1: When I'm contacted about my skills as a programmer, people jump right to asking "What sites have you built?"
Err, make that a language midterm exam (German). See how my brain is fried?
Just got home from a language final. It was purposely too hard to finish. Brain is now fried.
Hmm, Scott eVest makes a Browncoat-style jacket with 20 gadget-pockets. Tempting.
Tricking the thermostat into turning on the heater, because it's now down to 70 degrees in here. huzzah.
Studying for midterms. Wait, didn't I just do those?
More Redbull & reading tech books. w00t.
@ashedryden Uhh. I just make stuff w/ what I've got on hand. Stir Fry vegetables in (tahini) sesame oil & soy sauce, make rice, and mix.
Made sesame/tahiani rice and veggie stir fry. At least that's what I'd call it.
Full moon settling over the lake in a purplish sunset. Picturesque. Too bad it's cold and getting colder.
Google Reader Bundles are neat. How many have used them?
Mmm. Redbull.
@raster can we still use Google products if the company is evil?
@kevron that's what I didn't know. thnx :)
Tired. So sleeping. Yay.
Got cold outside & the sun's gone away, so I'm wrapped up in a blanket inside now, coding.
Layer Tennis has gone all Burroughs on me.
@ashedryden orly? Not quite sure what to make of the actual play by Taylor on this one.
@jasonsantamaria Love that we're getting some fonts and composition in this week's match. Serve++ :)
Just got home. Beautiful day, sitting out on the balcony w/ laptop, drinking a redbull, watching Layer Tennis. w00t.
@raster I need a few more positive reviews before I can put down the cash for one. And apparently wait until the end of Nov. now.
In the CompSci lab, chilling until class.
grah. partial text feeds make Matt angry! *hulk smash*
awake. barely.
Hrm. Google Reader bundles' feeds are almost all partial-text feeds or just headlines that point to the article (ie Scientific American) boo
@kevron I'm probably going to get the ASUS EeePC, if it ever ships, for even more mobile computing.
Mucking around with stuff on the Powerbook and installing updates. Going to have to use it for at least another month or two.
Wish the macmote worked with Last.fm client player
Wishing I had a movie to watch tonight.
Somewhere in these ten million aliens, there's got to be one that has a black ipod but isn't wearing a gimp suit...
Spending over 5 minutes now trying to find my own alien in the Facebook SaveanAlien app. Thanks Mike Arrington :)
I think I'm gonna stick with Tiger (10.4) because I don't have one of those iPhone rebates. kthx.
@atomicfork brilliant!
Tomorrow I'm going to try writing 2000-2500 words a try and see if I can do it. If I think I can, I'm doing NaNoWriMo.org this year :)
@heygabe pong!
Just realized how behind on my feeds am I; compounded by adding new feeds over the past few days. Funny how it doesn't phase me though.
Awake again. See a pattern here?
Making veggie sausages & then some eggy-in-the-basket. yum.
Out of quarters and need to do more laundry. Hrm.
@video_villian you know a funky fresh web designer who'll lay down some phat CSS/HTML w/ microformatizzles for neighborherd?
Remembered why I &lt;3 SubEthaEdit. Editing the same file on my laptop with file hosted on my desktop,can move around and go to the libr ...
@ashedryden Last.fm client app, tag "indie rock" works great :)
Switched back to Twitterrific because Snitter crashed :)
@ashedryden Added a bunch of new feeds (including googreader Bundles for Cars, Thinkers & Science) & its normalized at ~650
@video_villian I'm thinking of creating a series of luxeon 1W LED lamps that I can control centrally to brighten/dim. Mood lighting in t ...
I need to buy some more lamps or brighter lightbulbs or something. I demand more light!
Snitter doesn't work with Growl, but makes Growl-ish windows? It's probably a lack of a way to support Growl in AIR, but still.. :/
@video_villian Sending things to Earth...
Rockstarring...
Trying out Snitter. Liking everything but the fonts (they're not aliased very nice, look all chunky & funky)
Off to the grocery store to stock up on things like milk. Wish I had a closer store that I could just walk to every day.
Saying goodbye to my week-old scraggly beard.
Kevin Rose still has long hair in this week's Diggnation. They must've filmed it before The Lobby.
#conftour RIPE 56 meeting in Cologne May 5-9 2008, which is right before when I'll be in Germany. Think I can leave a week early & attend?
Drinking a redbull, considering playing Scrabulous.
Sleep now plz. kthnxbai.
Enough people are using StumbleUpon and liking it that I've decided to add it to Firefox. Trying it out now..
Off to another wonderful night class. Joy.
Playing with my Google Reader exported OPML file and trying to think of useful things to determine by parsing it with scripting langs.
&lt;3
@ashedryden your injury wins
Injured my index finger and can't type with it. Great.
@video_villain BCMilw2 footage on Revver is hilarious.
Just got home from a walk. It's cold outside! :)
I think Fake Steve Jobs is slowly mutating in Darth Vader. What, with all the hit squads and threats of violence now. Just sayin'
Awake. Reading Leopard reviews (still).
Gonna call it a night. Have to get up earlier than usual tomorrow.
588 unread. From your  118 subscriptions, over the last 30 days you read 6,523 items, starred 23 items, shared 0 items, and emailed 7 items.
Did some more work on cleaning up feeds tonight. Stats incoming...
Making a self-decaf'd soy chai latte w/ honey and cinnamon. It's as tasty as it is hard to say!
I wish I could scrobble over 170K tracks like @tapps. I guess I'm not that cool.
I'll admit to having spent a lot of time on this site back in 1998: 
btw, this is how I used to get around the net pre-feedreader. phew, that's a lot of sites to check daily: 
This is (mostly) archived: 
Aww, archive.org doesn't have copies of any of my old sites on Geocities & Xoom and the like. Remember those days?
Trying to look up old sites I had on archive.org, but can't remember URLs for a lot of them.
I think I gave StumbleUpon too many 'interests'.. the sites it is giving me are completely random.
Weird. Cellphone can't get through to the tower or something. Rebooting phone, but also preparing the "go-bag" just in case.
@ashedryden cooking, actually, but science works on lots of stuff :)
Don't do with elbow grease that which the laws of thermodynamics will do for you!
Focus, focus, focus, Matt.
Because I know you're tired of being RickRoll'd, I present the next big internetlinkingamajig meme: 
Dear Lake Michigan: you look great today. have you been working out?
Why is iTunes not a choice on Marble of Doom?
November is NaNoWebAppMo for me - National November Web App (dev) Month! Sorry, NaNoWriMo.org but I'm not a great writer anyways :)
Also possibly finishing annotaker (also needs a better name) and releasing under a free-for-educational-use license.
Neighborherd and Heartbot (needs better name) are under active development as of today. Need RoR and/or PHP hosting w/ good WI company tho.
Have to drive to the other end of town to pay rent. Trying to think of any good coffee shops along the way.
@pfhawkins meatspace is overrated.
Unusual influx of email.
Google Reader stats: 343 unread atm. From your  119 subscriptions, over the last 30 days you read 6,863 items, starred 28 items, & emailed 7
Anyone know if Google Reader sets unread posts to read/hidden (but not incrementing your read count) after 2 months or so of not being read?
@ people with Leopard: does iChat lose the 'metal' interface in favor of the new Leopard standard? Or does anyone even still use iChat?
Trying to find out on uwp.edu when my refund will come now that the state budget is all taken care of. Can't find anything useful @ the site
Back home. Hungry.
Singing the Saved by the Bell themesong. Dunno why.
@raster Newegg's the best bet, since Best buy is initially only carrying the Eee in big cities like New York and San Fran, from what I read
love the design of this: 
WTF, twitter just 'tweeted' something I txted in a couple days ago?
Dude in my class has an iphone
Twitter proves once again to provide news faster than anyone else.
You heard it here first: Neighborherd runs on Google OpenSocial. & has hAudio microformats. & other unreleased technology.
High Scalability Blog is good for info on platforms/software & case studies on companies. What's a good blog for info on server hardware?
I'll settle for a chai latte.
@raster but my water isn't caffienated & tasty :D
Debating whether it's a good idea to drink Redbull at 7:30PM.
Wish I could go to the Lunch 2.0 that Google is sponsoring in Chicago on the 9th (I have class.) I'll have to catch it next time.
Nevermind, must have been a bug in Twitteriffic. twitter.com works fine.
Twitter's all messed up for me. Poor confused twitter.
heating up leftovers for lunch. drinking a rockstar. gonna watch Galacticast & TRS in asec. pisisng off this guy: 
@blissdev watch the new galacticast until TRS seeds.
Perusing the NaNoWriMo forums while making dinner. Good thing I don't have much else to do tonight :)
Oops. That was @factoryjoe's example of how not to do OpenID in a signup form. Oh well, I didn't use my OpenID anyways.
Just signed up for a web app I found in a tab with the signup page open. Can't remember where I found the link or what the web app does yet.
re Twitterific 3: I can haz some screenshots of it plz?
Redbull is for win.
Back home. (trying to) write like crazy.
Heading out. Back in about an hour.
Aha. TextMate 1.5.7 is out which means I've got another 30 days. Which means it'll come NaNoWriMo. w00t.
Doh. Textmate is expired and it won't let me write my NaNoWriMo stuff in it. Going to have to save for the license (broke since I paid rent)
Just got home. Have about 40 minutes to write random stuff for NaNoWriMo I thought of during the day before I gotta head out for stuff.
Wrote a little for nanowrimo.org ... still don't know if I really want ot do it or not. Time to sleep, so I can write more after class
@raster I use Term.app with Visor & run a 'screen' session inside the Visor. Cmd-Tilde ftw! (Visor is from Blacktree, but the site is down)
vi mode for bash works wonders on the Mac, given that Terminal.app doesn't do stuff like Alt-Arrow (does Leopard fix it?)
doing some dishes. dunno what to do about dinner. suggestions?
Need a dashboard widget that updates my NaNoWriMo wordcount, since the site is so slow. Though I doubt there's an API for updating wordcount
Need to get a good solid wordcount done for NaNoWriMo today and carry the progress through the weekend. So what's holding me back right now?
@ashedryden mac OSX took a long time to get Spaces? X11-based window manager have had them forever...
Close gmail/greader, close a couple other tabs, save all tabs as bookmarks, close browser. Writing time! (with breaks to view layer tennis!)
Nice return by Armin in the @LayerTennis match
Doh, just spilled redbull all over. My pants now are high caffienated content.
It was such a nice day, I had to spend an hour or two walking in the park. Listening to podcasts on the iPod, of course.
I evaluate each situation for velorecipator attacks thanks to xkcd, but only because I'm already sizing up defense against zombie attacks
Keep hearing that "dig me up" song on the radio and thinking it would make a great montage with Kevin and Alex / Diggnation footage.
Just checked Google Reader. Haven't looked at it all day. Definitely need to trim down the number of feeds I'm watching if I keep ignoringit
3200 or so words for nanowrimo today. Good haul. Gonna go play Endgame: Singularity for awhile now & then sleep.
@raster skilled programmers are  allergic to working for financial institutions.
Anyone have a web-facing SVN server that wouldn't mind giving me a repo for backing up the relatively small text file of my NaNoWriMo novel?
slam-redbull, powernap, then write. we'll see how this goes.
Just got the feedburner ad "Field Workers Dispatch Software: Discover better, more affordable way to manage field works" wtf
I like that you can pause Pandora radio, whereas w/ Last.fm you press stop and can't come back to the same song or even spot in it
Just saw a Ford Fiesta (or maybe a Geo Metro) go by with little cartoony wings painted on teh sides. Funny.
btw, twitterers who are doing NaNoWriMo: my userpage is  add me as a writing buddy! :)
Twitter seems broken again. Restarting Twitterrific to see if that fixes it.
That cup of coffee didn't work; it only lasted for a couple hundred words. Making Dragon Roost coffee (it's got yerba mate & ginseng in it!)
Sooo tempted to spend the day in Google Sketchup making 3D models of cool stuff from my NaNoWriMo than actually writing it.
Refeshing my nanowrimo profile page doesn't magically make the wordcount go up. I guess I have to write.
coffee break!!
Why are there more trailers on apple.com/trailers than in Frontrow? Doesn't make sense...
ahaha. code raving ftw. 
Trying to figure out a travel plan to Chicago with @nungana. Thinking I overplan things like this too much.
@4braham as long as they come out with a special Donnie Darko dvd with more bonus features as a cross promotion, I'm game.
@4braham i've been waiting for that movie for awhile now. looks good.
Did I already complain about the slowness of nanowrimo.org and suggest they should use a scalable architecutre on EC2/S3 next year?
@pfhawkins Yeah, I have a love/hate relationship with Redbull. My true feelings are for Rockstar sugar-free in the white cans :)
Got sidetracked from my original plan. Learning Python (well, I already know Python, just not the libs) to hack on Endgame: Singularity code
pandora-fm mashup ftw. Check out this station: 
where the eff is the sun? oh wait.
@v3rt1g0 can I write you in as fighting them off with a leafblower?
@v3rt1g0 I plan todo that as a contingency measure. Then just say it was all a nightmare of the main char. And every dream after has zombies
*grumbles* I should've written a novel about zombies. I could write lots of gory words about zombies.
Quickest way to see if someone is following you on twitter? View their profile + with_friends/ on the URL, send a twitter, and watch 4 tweet
Picked up a bottle of Gamer Fuel on the way back from my little walk. Windy down here today.
@kevron congrats. I wonder if the iPhone will make more 'switchers' than the iPod did.
NaNoWriMo update: Broke 9K words just now, going to take a break and go for a walk; have to break 12K by midnight tonight.
@v3rt1g0 I should restate that: you can build up a sleep deficit, but it's not as easy to balance as sleeping the equiv # hours  on weekends
@ashedryden be a customer service ninja: 
Lunch + Rockstar, writing. Maybe study a little later, but luckily this past week wasn't very intensive academically for me.
@v3rt1g0 "catching up" on sleep is apparently been disproven by science, but I agree, that extra hour of sleep was great.
"That was probably something important you just unplugged."
Slept in and yet its early. Wait, what?
Don't ask how I got baking soda & peroxide toothpaste in my eye. Ow ow ow, it burns. If I'm blind in the morning, blame Arm&Hammer
dressing up as FSJ for halloween would have been great. "Dude, I invented the freaking iPhone. Have you even heard of it?"
this week's diggnation brought to you by lots and lots of awkward homoerotic moments. you've been warned.
diggnation is downloaded, so it's time to watch & have some beers, then crash and hope to write a lot of words tomorrow.
Am I clever or just crazy? I don't think recursion is allowed in fiction. Nano WC: 7712 & trying for some more tonight yet.
Any awesome twitterers from Chicago going to the Google Lunch 2.0 next Fri and have a couch/floor I can crash on? :P
off to class
@wakest wait until they reveal the Google Lunar Lander (codename Spaceballs) & their sentient AI (codename Icarus) next week!
Would like to read the content National Geographic sends to my feedreader, but they're not even partial feeds, just summary, so unsubscribed
@ashedryden doh. I forgot it was the fifth until I read your tumblr.
Sorting through all the tweets I missed while I was in class.
Busy morning for me.
NaNoWriMo WC: 12K. That's quota. Night folks.
Need 500 words. Any 500 words. grumblemumble
@heygabe Macbook w/ external monitor :D
Playing with a photo in photoshop rather than writing or coding or H/W
@v3rt1g0 yeah I'm back and safe and such :)
NaNoWriMo placeholders: "there's like, a big battle here. with spacerobotninjas!" not really tho. kthxbai.
Had a scare there. My key to the outside door on my building wouldn't work no matter what I tried & didn't have my cellphone or wallet.
Can't figure out how to reprogram my microwave's time, since there's no obvious CLOCK buttons etc. Might just unplug it & let it flash 12:00
I have a cold. Bah humbug.
Google Reader is all screwed up this morning for no reason. I'm off to class.
Rambled for 500 words in my text editor, but couldn't really make anything work. Going to be behind on my schedule for hte week.
@raster you mean you're listening to something other than Ted Leo and the Pharmacists?
Built half a papercraft Guy Fawkes mask and gave up.
Haven't been able to write for NaNoWriMo today. Not good.
The state awarded me $1900 in fall financial aid, and I paid my full tuition at the start of the semester, so I'm why is my refund $600? wtf
NaNoWriMo update: 13K wc reached, must reach 15K tonight, & 25K by the weekend. In the words of hte Beastie Boys, "Now get busy"
cofffee coffee coffee coffee, badger badger...
Playing Scrabulous on facebook.
Home. Gotta write a decent amount today to catch up to my week 1 quota for NaNoWriMo.
Using a (faculty-only) computer to twitter during our study session :) Out of cash and they only take cash @ on-campus coffee shop. gah :/
Cannot seem to intimidate this cold by shouting THIS IS SPARTA. New tactics needed.
This cold/headache thing knocked me out for the better part of today, gonna sleep and hope it goes away
My favorite part of fall: apple cider. mmm.
Web414 meeting is the most-attended event on the Milwaukee Facebook network, apparently.
MIT Open Course Ware Linear Algebra video lectures through iTunes -&gt; semester of knowledge in one day in prep for my real classes.
My annotation web app is going to get scrapped and rewritten, as soon as I'm done with NaNoWriMo. All the more reason to finish early :)
Twitterrific and/or Growl aren't working. Too tired to worry about that right now.
Super Mario Bros rather than NaNoWriMo. heh.
Tried to explain (read: pitch) my edu-use web app to some profs today after a meeting. Basically said they wouldn't use it much less pay 4it
Just got home. Going to catch up on Layer Tennis in 15 min bursts.
"Meets requirements for "Emergency Destruction" of Hard Drives containing Top Secret data." lawls. 
Wishing I had the means to go hang out with @nungana when he gets to Chicago.
Considering throwing away all this Computer Science/Web stuff and becoming a scholar of ancient archaeology. Fedora and whip included.
Too energetic to sleep, too brain-drained to do anything constructive. Bah.
Greader: Unsubscribed from lots of inactive/dead feeds, and then the top spammy feeds that I don't read anymore, as well as partial-text 1s
CSS theming in Snitter? Sweet. Why didn'y anyone tell me about this?
Back to using Snitter for awhile. Is there a way to change the font it displays tweets with?
Nvm, didn't know that Verizon Wireless's site had all the phones offered & I could search by models with QWERTY keyboard.
What's a good/cheap cellphone that has a qwerty keyboard and works on Verizon? Something like a Sidekick, maybe?
Dear craigslist posters: "web / info design" jobs category does not include CAD modeling. Stop posting in there.
Brainstorming ideas. NaNoWriMo all but abandoned at this point due to other priorities.
Coffee isn't strong enough until you can't see daylight through it.
@ashedryden No, I'm at home.
@nungana sorry I'm not there :(
Can someone update me on the status of Open Social? Can we develop on top of it right now? It seemed to fall off the radar.
Since everyone is talking about their dinner: Boca lasagna here :)
@raster that's the best way to get the pocket lint off :)
Writing Ruby and Erlang side by side to try out an idea I have.
@nungana it's a trap! they're really nasty when they can be, at least compared to how folks to behave in Wisconsin :)
Brilliant: 
Okay, I lied. Watched diggnation. Now I can sleep.
Google Reader now under 400 unread. (was 1000+ all week) Some sanity restored. Mail inbox empty. Time for sleep and great justice and such.
NaNoWriMo WC: 15319. If I'm going to continue, it'll be at this slower pace.
@tapps maybe they actually know Latin (lorem ipsum is nonsense in Latin, or at least)
No one has said in an OLPC XO review if you can actually type with adult-sized hands on it for any length of time. Debating it vs EeePC
Code Monkey song + thinkgeek Code Monkey shirt + coffee = funny morning for no reason.
More lulz for you, twitternets: 
New Mac/PC commercials are awesome: 
I love how "deep-linking" to newspaper's articles is against their ToS. A blogger linking to their site would draw traffic to their site.
@videovillain this a pretty good example: 
Blinded by new desk lamp. It also takes up 1/3 of the desk, It maybe wasn't a great choice.
Someone tell me why they tagged Usher's Track 03 'o Rap as "coding" on last.fm, and why last.fm client always wants to play it for me? Sigh.
Rough day. (Maybe) going to get the Jeep fixed this afternoon.
Should go to class instead of sitting here reading feeds.
Up and running with Monotone as my new revision (source code) control system & liking it. Glad I caught that session at BarCampMKE2 :)
@hober their host, Rackspace, seems to have a major outage in their Dallas datacenter right now.
Just closed like 40 tabs. I need a computer with more RAM, this macmini is maxe dout.
Want to write code. Have homework. Bah humbug.
Back home from class.
Is it bad to find a girl more attractive when she's got a really nice laptop in front of her?
Unusually optimistic about tomorrow.
Me time: Green tea and coding. Too frustrated with classes to do H/W tonight (I'll leave that for time spent in the library tomorrow mor ...
@raster Bug me for invite code later tonight. :P
[crowdsourcing] What is one book that you highly recommend? (on any topic)
(maybe) fixing teh Jeep today. We'll see.
I'm a programmer. I program. That's all I do.
@raster Next (insert web414 meeting date here) can I check it out to decide if I'll get one?
Using Google Reader's Trends page to unsubscribe from stuff I'm not reading or don't have the time to watch. Want less than 100 feeds.
Saw Flags of Our Fathers after dinner earlier. Good movie.
Jeep now has a new wiring harness for almost all the circuits under the hood, and the brightest headlights you can legally run. Huzzah.
One can get a used macmini w/ core2duo for under $300 on eBay (already upgraded to max 2gb of RAM even) I'd use Synergy & dual-boot to Linux
Just got back from a walk in time to watch Layer Tennis. Coding, listening to music, drinking a Rockstar :)
New reddit shirt is boss.
Making coffee and having some lunch. Preparing mentally for watching layer tennis. Heh.
Startup Schwag came today: reddit tshirt & stickers from clutterme, wedigtv, disqus "first post!", Chicagoproper, propertymaps & fuser. w00t
Done for today. 'Night twitter.
Tried Droid Sans Mono (no zero-slash), Bitstream Mono, Envy Code R, etc. but didn't like them. Sticking with Monaco for now.
Looking for a replacement for Monaco font. I need a fixed width with slashed zeroes that looks good w/ no anti-aliasing @ 9pt.
Brewed up a monster latte with two shots of the strongest espresso I can brew on my little machine.
Grey morning, calls for some dark coffee & vegetarian brainfoods.
Dell's $350 Ubuntu desktop isn't a bad deal. 1.6Ghz dual core, 1gb RAM, 250gb hdd, and monitor included.
Lawls, but still interesting: 
@4braham nice setup.
@4braham what are you running? (specs-wise)
Wish I could focus better. Or maybe procrastinate less. When I decide which one of those it is, I'll let you know.
Can't get Snitter to run today. Dunno why my mac decided to suddenly be so messed up.
I could conceivably code in no less than 24 programming language environments on my mac right now. win.
The challenge lies in creating something normal people will want to use, whereas I used to think I just had to make things for geeks like me
Keychain seems to have forgotten all my passwords. For everything. Nice.
@4braham same here, but I keep waking up at noon.
Too many tabs open, as usual. 'Read it Later' addon for Firefox is cool, but I think it is the reason Firefox is being so crashy
Love that my gmail inbox gets text ads for "crazy servers" ...
Saturday night funtime assignment for everyone: Write 140 character programs  in Brainf*ck and post to twitter.
Cellphone keeps crashing and requiring a restart. Interesting.
A macmini sitting on a RAIDed eSATA drive (hack macmini for eSATA plug) would be comparable in size to a Qube, but much more powerful server
Tip: don't knock the power supply for a Qube3 server off the shelf, thus unplugging it. fsck'ing the disks takes forever on a slow Qube.
Funny post about the "vi gang sign" aka the shocker - 
Note: Don't email your mom theURL  off the top of your head to explain a "Kevin Rose haircut" VW=NSFMoms
Fearing that those photos of me will show up on the flickr homepage ala Bronze mirrr dude. Altho I don't look quite as freaky as Bronze dude
The hair massacree: 
Aha. Just figured out Quicksilver. Worth using it now, I guess.
Gah. She lopped off all my hair in response to asking for it "shorter, not so shaggy." I'm unwillingly sporting the new Kevin Rose look.
Going to get a (hopefully quick) haircut down teh street.
@raster I think 10.4.11 hosed my keychain, among other things. Wouldn't recommend the upgrade.
[crowdsourcing] Who on twitter colos servers instead of virtual private hosting / shared hosting? Doing research for an idea.
Making breakfast and some coffee. Take that, people who don't want ot know what I'm eating!
Feeling great after a walk in the park. At least it's not too cold out.
Amazed that I haven't been outbid on eBay on a quadcore barebones server.
Diggnation watched, beers consumed. Past tense actions.
Signed up to receive more information on any possibility of a StartupWeekend in Chicago for 2008. Would definitely do it.
Less than 100 unread items in Google Reader for the first time in forever. I expect the Monday-morning postings will fix that.
Free (as in worthless) idea of the day: register Survivali.st and launch social network for sharing and comparing injuries you've sustained.
My Keychain got hosed, hence why everything is so weird today. No idea why Snitter won't start though.
Server got sniped for over $400 at the end of the auction with several people bidding it up. That's okay, I didn't want to spend that much.
Obviously not including the Linux workstations in the computer science lab :D
By the way, a little bit of sleuthing found that almost every non-thinterm computer at uwp.edu is running on the Storm botnet. Nice.
Tense few minutes until the eBay auction ends.
Girl: "Why do you have 'Wardriver' on your shirt? it doesn't even mean anything." Me: "Oh, you know. It's that band." heh
Still might win the server on eBay. Cool.
Trying to prune my "read it later" addon list.
May end up with sweet barebones server (for doing dev work) if I don't get outbid on this eBay auction.
[crowdsourcing] Who uses craigslist? Okay, now who uses some other similar thing online, like Facebook Marketplace? (and what is it?)
Now is the time to be quoting Yoda. "Do or do not. There is no try."
Is there a setting somewhere in Quicksilver for the selected pane when you invoke the QS window? Mine always seems to have the right pan ...
It's a very grey day. Wishing for sun.
I guess this makes me a New Media Douchebag: 
Street address # is much less important than matching the City/zipcode and the actual street, I'd think.
Verizon's FiOS site can't find my address because their algorithm sucks. I put in"222 10th Str, Kenosha WI" for ex. and it finds 222 123 ...
I slept for a total of 5 minutes or so last night. Crazy.
Always nice to realize it's 5AM and you just can't get to sleep. Insomnia sucks.
Trying to navigate amazon.co.jp despite not being able to read japanese. They don't have English descriptions for most items. A good thing.
Is Intel Penryn going to push down the cost of other Intel Core 2 Duo processors? what do you guys think?
Basically got nothing done today. Too distracted. Oh well.
Sitting around, browsing the web on my laptop, because family is doing nothing.
Web worker skill #29: Knowing how to pack a giant messenger bag with your laptop, books, & everything else so that it won't shift around :)
Packing for traveling. Joy.
I'm dreaming of a... white Thanksgiving?
For some reason a programming language like this is really appealing to me: 
Sleep now (hopefully). wish me luck, heh...
@philcrissman is it at least php5 w/ OO allowed?
Blog post about why I haven't been blogging. Oh, the meta. 
Apparently I can't import more feeds into tumblr. I guess that makes sense from a scaling perspective. From the user perspective, its silly.
@raster let me know what you think of it.
or I should say, the macmini didn't restart, just kept running.
Just had a scary brownout (at least in terms of computer-frying).. it dimmed the lights & reset my screen and router, but macmini was fine.
Family trying to start fights with eachother, which is why I didn't want to stay the second day. First over rolls, now over making coffee :(
Where do you draw the line about buying and using products from immoral companies?
I've been computer-less/internet-less for the past two days, and its making me grumpy.
Heading to the Farwell Alterra in Milw for coffee & wifi later this morning, if anyone wants to meet up, send DM.
Reading Raster's review of the Eee PC.
Reading the news on my laptop while everyone reads the newspaper.
OH: what part of the forest has a wood floor?
For the record, Anodyne has really great coffee. I wish I lived near that neighborhood of Milw w/ all the cool cofee shops & stores.
At home in Kenosha. Finally.
Going to Anodyne Coffee on Brady, be there in 30-45 minutes. Need sanity.
Heading out to shop, which I dislike. But it must be be done
@kevron word.
Coffee coffee coffee coffee.
@philcrissman yeah, the method overloading is funky in PHP 5. not sure what I ever did to get around that.
Papyrus is one of those fonts that makes the font-people's skin crawl.
My uncle is starting a coffee roasting business, but I need to convince him to use a different font than Papyrus for the labels.
What's new on the intertubes this morning?
My ISP's DNS servers must be down. Switched the desktop over to OpenDNS IPs for now / no way to set DNS servers on my router.
Newegg won't take my credit card anymore, so no ordering from them until their credit processing changes its mind. Suggestions for a sim ...
@blakehall it's not letting me edit barcamp.org just now, but in any case, I'm in :)
In study group during lunch hour, drinking a terrible Starbucks drip coffee (blech) and wish I had food.
@raster can we watch Helvetica and drink Bold coffee?
@v3rt1g0 I dunno. Ask Ashe :)
Tried Smultron and Komodo Edit, didn't like either.
Need a free editor for Mac OS X (for programming, so features centered around that is good). TextMate & SubEthaEdit ran out, no jEdit plz.
What do you mean, coffee will kill me?
Funny thing about that Ron Paul Blimp site: they compare Boston Tea Party to Americans dumping millions of $ into Ron Paul's campaign. wtf
Making coffee in my new Chemex coffee-pitcher-pourover thing. Tasty. 
It's so sunny, I started humming the Sesame Street song. Heh.
Is Newegg slow/down for anyone else?
Back from night class.
Almost forgot that some old lady called me a 'junkie' today. Do I really look that bad? :/

Does any company make a EeePC/OLPC XO-sized laptop bag yet? They redesigned the Tom Bihn Buzz slingbag to be BIGGER, so can't go with that.
@heygabe EeePC is sold out at Newegg, but the OLPC XO has much lower specs and probably just barely runs the GUI + apps. Screen is bette ...
Ron Paul support all over campus & an info kiosk is set up. I'm all about freedom but I think they're neglecting parts of his platform.
I know we have to warn people with allergies, but I think it's just plain silly when my milk carton reads: Warning. Contains Milk.
Grinding coffee, making coffee, drinking coffee. win.
xkcd made my day.
It isn't that TV killed the radio star, it's that TV killed good entertainment.
Home from helping my uncle string up Christmas lights. Yes, in November. Who decided things got started this early, anyways? Wal-Mart?
I have Ze Frank's Scared song stuck in my head. Random.
I have more hours of podcasts to listen to this week than there are hours in teh week. Oops.
@heygabe I was hoping that link would lead to Classic BattleTech comics.
Luckily the people in justin.tv chatrooms probably don't use/read twitter. The conversation during the OAuth event was painful at times.
or rather, subversion as a server is a pain on Mac OSX, due to the Apache server that Mac OSX ships with needing to be replaced, etc. Sa ...

@v3rt1g0 no monotone?
Watching the justin.tv tech talk live featuring Leah Culver talking about OAuth: 
I was apparently part of the Twitter @reply bug. Rock on: 
I have to say, though, a framework without documentation causes trial and error, which is a terrible way to code.
Played w/ the Shoes framework in Ruby & hacked on the sample edit.rb code. Now I've got a very simple vim clone with key commands & buttons.
@caw is there any other documentation for Shoes other than the few tutorials on hackety.org?
Coffee is powering geek-hackery. In usual geek form, I've found the hard(est) way to solve this problem (also most satisfying solution).
Doing nothing.
Sunny and snow-free here today. Nice weather given the season. Off to do chores and then sit in the coffee house and read. (offline even!)
New blog post last night took longer to write than the little app I'm talking about in it: 
@4braham I am the center of twitter, apparently.
I'm too tired to finish editing this blog post tonight, so I'm making it public and awaiting your comments: 
@v3rt1g0 it was like 6 hours ago. I'll take one when I go back..
Forgot to twitter a most unfortunate translation I read on a bottle @ Walgreens: "Smooth over entire corpse." Guessing they meant 'body'...
and of course, in the process of writing the cheatsheet widget in Shoes with MacVim, I reinforced remembering all the vi commands. win.
Wrote another Shoes app (Ruby GUI framework). It's sort of a widgetized version of my old "vi quick reference" cheat sheet, to remind me ...
Somehow good coffee after 7PM creates great coding, once I eliminate distractions.
Current software I use everyday on Mac: Firefox, iTunes, TextMate, Terminal, Snitter. That's it. Add MacVim to that list if I keep for m ...
Just found out about MacVim, which is a Cocoa interface for vim. Very cool, as vi is my CLI editor of choice. It even has tabs!

Flash layer tennis today. w00t.
s/chores/errands/ I'm misusing words today an awful lot.
My phone goes from full charge to literally 2 minutes of talk time before it shuts itself off from 'low battery'. Stupid Moto.
Just drop the Jeep down the block and back to determine the likelihood of making it to Milw tonight. Survey says: highly unlikely.
Just plain snow here, and not much of it. Still planning to head to Milwaukee tonight.
The phrase "semi-literally" is new to me. How exactly does one determine whether something's semi-literal or not?
Finally upgraded the firmware of the Qube3. Was afraid it would brick it, but it didn't. Going from 2.2 kernels to booting 2.4 & 2.6
Snowing here now.
Hoping the storm holds off until I get to Milwaukee for @VideoVillain's party.
Black EeePC for $299 (not the surf) 
Afraid they're going to shut off my electricity. Just paid the past due bill that I forgot about.
Slow morning.
zooomr++ for having OpenID and mf, awesome features, localizing into new markets, & proof that you don't need millions to dev a hot web app.
apparently my blog is "highly pretentious" according to this email ... score!
Re-arranged stuff while cleaning (moved servers into the closet for an overnight 'heat' test) at casa mathias
@laughingsquid what is that called? a twitjacking? doesn't sound right..
I keep referring to 'neighborherd' when really it should read 'my latest web app project' as it has changed tremendously since BarCampMKE2.
neighborherd (in private beta for those lucky enough) is apparently competing in the same problem domain as: 
The colors outside right now look straight out of 28 Days Later.
Why don't people get that learning new stuff will make you a better coder, whether its Lisp or Rails or whatever. Can't stay in Java forever

Anyone wanna go to Ignite Chicago 12/6 ? I'm gonna catch the Metra there and back out of Kenosha.
Apparently I'd need much shorter bangs to successfully pull off a faux-hawk. Right now I look like the villain from The Incredibles.
@CDavis last time I had to change something like that, it was in a BIOS that was tricky to get into. But that was a Compaq laptop, heh.
GReader: "From your  106 subscriptions, over the last 30 days you read 6,727 items, starred 21 items, shared 0 items, and emailed 2 items."
I think I just saw a Yeti out there. Maybe it was the mail carrier all bundled up, though.
Zero unread Google reader items.. makes me happy..
@nungana I'm planning to take zero credits.
Anyone else going to Mashable's MashMeet Chicago event on the 7th?
Watching diggnation. Finishing off all the beer in my fridge. Lamenting the fact that I'm not partying it up at the Korporate shindig.
Snitter's Leopard skin is okay, but I want an iPhone theme.
Big difference between saying something is "easily parallelized" and "easily paralyzed"
Cool concept: 
@4braham added you as friend on reddit. For anyone else on reddit: 
*now* the snow plows go through. Could've used that 3 hours ago.
mmm, fruit smoothie.
Wondering if the Korporate party will get rescheduled? Weather sucks too much to take the freeway right now.

Crazy coding. lastfm client assisting with the music selection. 3 books, 2 servers, laptop & main machine on, 4 terminals & an editor window
@nungana my secret is to write my conclusion first, 'restating' all the points that will resonate in the paper. Then write the rest.
Difference between running my Linux PC as a server and running the Qube 3: about 400W. Really. The Qube uses less power than my macmini.
Qube3 status: 2.4 kernel in ROM is most stable. Apache2, Ruby, rubygems, Rails & Mongrel all running nicely. Next month: more RAM & new HDDs
New rule: If I can't explain how something works on one side of an index card before coding it, it's too complicated. Simplify, then code.

Made edits all over my blog post so its is worth refreshing, btw.
@kevron it's possibly that wordpress.com gets polled a lot more than random_blog.com with only 3 subscribers.
It's snowing again, btw.
My latest (inflammatory) blog post:    It's far from done, and I need to trim it down a couple hundred words or so.
@nungana @cthielen it's roughly 30 degrees here (and about 22 after wind chill)
Gah, if I went back and added links to this blog post, there would be links on almost every line. I assume you guys are smart enough to  ...
Here comes another bubble (video):  Word.
I am a longwinded blogger. I think I secretly hope it eliminates the impatient trolls.
Feeling behind today. Luckily I had the morning off.
Don't really know whether to use something as a category or a tag when I write a blog post on WP. Going to stick with tagging everything.
Me, last night in Unix class:"But what do you need 200 servers for?!" Reason:Old, inefficient servers = wasted energy 
@tapps You could so burn them w/ "1998 called, it wants its HTML back."
Doh. Will I regret this?
Lots of neat stuff going on outside of the range I can realistically drive to attend. PSIG meeting in Arlington, IL and MinneDemo.org
To my 'wishlist' Linux WM that has QS and Growl built in, add allowing apps to popup a transparent help like this: 
Nasty strong coffee to stay awake (read: alive) for the next few hours.
Is there a Linux window manager with Quicksilver and Growl-type features built in, by any chance?
@tapps I saw it in Chris Messina's (@factoryjoe) flickr stream :D
Sites should not be able to resize currently existing windows. I hate that.
Stupid Mac trick: $ killall Dock (don't hit return, shift-minimize a window, quickly switch to terminal and hit enter. Frozen genie window.
Survived the great we-don't-remember-how-to-drive-in-snow day of 2007.
Grew up in the UP, so I know how to recover from understeer and oversteer skids & 4 wheel slides. fun day.
@CDavis: I live on the lake. I can't see it. :D
I'm not too tightly-coupled to using Monotone as my VCS at this point, so I may try out Git and Mercurial just to see what those are like.
@4braham My school has a competitor to Blackboard. All of the commercial ones seem terrible.
My hipster PDA is all the loose index cards from my desk & book bag clipped together. I use lots of index cards. so it's getting fairly big.

@raster "unlawful use of computerized communication systems" oh great, now commenting anonymously on blogs is unlawful use.
I think I'll wait for a Diamondville processor-based laptop that's like the Eee PC, rather than trying to get the few Eees that are left.
running out for a bit, then back home for dinner and coding.
@philcrissman I subscribed to sixteen languages blog from your shared feed, looks like a neat (if crazy) idea. :)
Supercomputer pics:  I particularly like the SiCortex SC5832. It'd look good next to my futon.
I can't believe Cray is still around, much less a relevant part of the supercomputer industry.

A nice complement to Programming Language Inventor or Serial Killer is this blog post on The Programmer Dress Code: 
Watching old Ze Frank, wishing he was back from hiatus.
Worthwhile procrastination in getting Trac running on the devserver. Worthwhile in the sense that it wasn't coding, but might help out later
@VideoVillain enjoying the video layer tennis this week?

Steppenwolf's Magic Carpet Ride.. Last.fm, you know exactly how to make my day.
Random disco from the fmr. soviet union? Yes plz: 
Less than 20 unread in my greader? Crazy. Back to studying.
Today's required reading, Joel Spolsky's latest post: 
Lately, I seem to get the best work done between 7PM and 3AM after a cup or two of really good coffee. Plays havoc on early mornings, sadly.
Random question, but has anyone on Twitter read Charles Stross' science fiction/cyberpunk novel Accelerando?
"firefox prevented this site from opening 25 popup windows" ouch. 
Re-reading PJ Plauger's Programming on Purpose today, drinking vast quantities of fine coffees, and being cold.

Trying to concentrate, but the neighbors are having a party.
Mmm. Dinner was a greek spinach salad, freshly-baked Tuscan bread (still warm) and apple cider.
@cthielen just made my coffee actually.. and yes, they do, but it's still Starbucks and it's still fairly terrible.

Made it back to kenosha county. weather pretty bad. cars in ditch. no snowplows
Home at last after @VideoVillain 's fine media presentation and subsequent after-party-thing. Roads are quite awful in this area w/ the snow
@VideoVillain leaving soon for Milw.
@pfhawkins the world is rapidly converging on Stross's future, but the scariest part is when I think of myself as pulling a Mannfred Macx :)

Being covered in coffee is not exactly as sexay as I imagined it would be. Luckily I had time to run home between classes.
@marcusnelson lies! you can live indefinitely on coffee! :)
We're at the point where the net is simply too vast to have any meaningful discussion of what we saw online, because no one else will see it
Coffee from the free sample of beans I picked up at Dunn Bros last night. If you're frugal enough, you could probably drink samples forever.
@cthielen my twitter-teachings have epic fail. sorry.  I meant I catch who others are talking to, include those people in my twitterverse.
I don't use Synergy, but it would be useful right now. I wish it could magically pull running programs from one machine to the other though.
@cthielen The way I meet people on twitter is catching their @person messages, then I go look at that person's profile & usually follow.
Off to Dunn Bros. Kenosha to study and get some work done -- neighbors too noisy again.
Off to grab some dinner then night class. Coding afterwards.
Best phrase I've read today: "The newborn movement has come trailing blogs of glory"
My feedreader laughs at the puny number of posts generated by the blogosphere this day.
@tapps believe it or not, there's an even better antiRSI app on Linux, with little cartoon people illustrating desk exercises & stretches.
If I didn't get invites out to everyone, it's because I don't have your email address. Sorry about that.

Forgot the obvious solution: Boot up laptop and mount macmini in target mode, fix disk. Of course the Apple solution is two own two Macs.
Don't be offended if I just unfollowed you. Getting way too many tweets from people I follow but don't know personally & sadly can't keep up
mac is finding something wrong with its disk when I use disk utility (last.fm borking was a symtom) can't find OSX Install disk to fix with
Oops. I broke Last.fm
Empty inbox, empty feedreader = clear mind for hacking on code. That said, I'm still not getting much done tonight.

Foxboro Hottubs' Myspace page with three songs: 
heard about FoxboroHottubs on the radio on the way home, and that the free EP on their site is now gone. Did no one think to make a torrent?
Home sweet home.
Heh, Jott is pretty cool.

Sometimes I try to recapture the childlike wonder of the early web (at least in 96-97 when I started using it) so I google "monster trucks"
T-Mobile blocking Twitter: proof that we need net neutrality for all sorts of networks and that the phone companies need to go away.
Song and dance routine.
Finally found a place to download the Foxboro Hottubs album. Surprised that it isn't on any of the torrent sites. Also, beware of spyware.
Drinking jasmine green tea, strumming guitar. Fearing the impending doom of finals week part 2.
Nice day out, despite the roads still not completely cleaned up. I even walked through teh park!
I love when sites throw up the "You don't have the latest version of Flash!" page to me. No, actually, you coded your site wrong, pal.
Why do we always wonder what could have been, instead of making those things happen?
@tapps @VideoVillain sounds like I'll have to buy another 500 gigs or so of external storage.
@tapps we can trade musics sometime? i wouldn't mind another 90 gigs of tunes. kthnxinadvance ;)
Uhh, must be a party in the building. Two random people making out on the dryer when I went to go get my laundry.
Keep trying to update podcasts in iTunes, hoping the new diggnation is out.
The yeti are enjoying this weather, I'm sure.
@nungana now plz do all my coding for me kthnxbai.
Yay. Twitter.. wait, what? it never went out?! I self-imposed non-twittering for nothing?!
Back to UWP for another final. oh, the joy!
OH in the hall: "It's like one of them Oomp-Loompa dances or something down there."
You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll maybe learn a little Japanese. You'll "never want to hear or make music again": 
@VideoVillain Don't feed it after midnight. And never, never, get it wet!

@kevron @videovillain the drives don't have that much throughput yet anyways. But SSD will need more bandwidth at some point.
Another final done, completed as I walked out the Highlander music played and lightning took flared(?). 
Off for round 2 of finals. Wish me luck.
@tonystark are you throwing a New Years party, by any chance? No, I'm not asking just so I can "borrow" the suit...  so, can I borrow it? :D

@compujeramey Apple spice beer. minireview in about 20 after the fridge cools them off.
Unix final completed; I was the first one done. Exam was open book/notes but I forgot those. Now for listening to Monzy & drinking Leinies.
Let me rephrase that: Please don't default to "Sort by Price: High to Low" every time I pull up a new page on said site. It's annoying.
Only a company would think to put options like "Sort Price: High to Low" on their online stores. I don't know any people that want that.
@innushka re: twitter from your phone. Try jott.com they do speech-to-text for you when you call their number & put it on twitter for you.

I upgraded Snitter, so now I need to send a twoosh to hear the new noise mmkay?  So this tweet is going to go on for a little longer. There.
Hyperlinks, include the period or no? I'm against including the punctuation. It just looks cleaner.
@raster AT&T's Apple options are amazing!
beer minireview: Leinenkugel Apple Spice. Not quite apple-y enough to be 'apple' to me. Good, though, very light. Also, no hops flavor here.
I don't know if my Tweeterboard stats are correct. I usually tweet more than once an hour.. except for when I'm in class or asleep or.. oh.
Off to take the final Final. w00t.

@kevron yes. I'm a recovering Phish fan.
Trying to bootstrap brain with coffee so I can make it to my German final
Just watched the trailer for Prince Caspian. Unsure whether they're going to be more true to the book than the old film. Looks very LotR.
I guess I have two weeks or so left in 2007 to totally rock out and correct the order of that list :)
Oh man, Jack Johnson is kind of embarassing to have on there:

Taking some time off twitter. to play guitar. yes.

I need more caffiene. But first food.
Hiho, hiho, you'd think it's off to work I go, but no, I've been reading Thoreau, hiho, hiho hiho..
Heh. Little amplifier is fun. Like putting it through a full pedalboard full of gain (read: distortion) pedals and seeing what speaker does.
@tapps I saw the Dandy Warhols in Seattle in... gah, I can't even remember the year. heh.
@tapp from your last.fm... dandy warhols used to be my favorite indie band way back in HS.. and I don't have any of their music now :(
@tapps ah. then again, you may not wish it was more interesting. getting mugged/attacked is stressful for a long time after the fact.
the joke w/ those pictures is that Orange are British handmade amps, usually in the thousands of dollars. mine was considerably less.
@tapps is there a story behind that? one that I want to hear, that is?
@VideoVillain it has headphone-out, which means line-in to my macmini+garageband now (which is good b/c I don't own any mics+firewire boxes)
@tapps I'll see yur "new hdd came today" and raise you a "new guitar amp came today"  
@tapps please don't tell me you're talking about transferring mp3s to this thing: 
Feeling very anti-everything tonight. "No Donny, these men are nihilists. There's nothing to be afraid of"
So now sending support emails is enough of a reason for a company to put me on their spammy-email SALE!/announcements list?
Heard the song Hail the Geeks tonight on my car's radio coming home. The RIAA is now commoditizing my subculture, & poorly. This means war.
@compujeramey acquired some Leinie's Sunset Wheat per your recommendation. initial impressions: impressed. this is good stuff.
@tapps sorry, it's gotta be Oasis. Not my choice :(
Got followed home (read: tailgated) the entire way by a police cruiser. Which should make me feel safe, yet I'm just glad I didn't get tased
As I just mentioned on Pownce, I'm looking for a song: Wonderwall by Oasis (don't ask) and could someone plz help a brother out? email=fine
Missing albums that were lost in the Great External Hard Drive Crash(es) of 2007.
Been listening constantly to music (as evidenced by my last.fm profile) to ward off the holiday/finals/work-induced insanity.
c-c-c-changes.
I can just transfer my photos off my cellphone that easily? Why didn't anyone tell me?!!?!
Had this idea just now for a week long unconference on the train that crosses Canadia's wilderness. Probably wouldn't be wifi though.
Redbull + cold medicine may be the best thing ever for clearing your head. Not sure yet, though. Heh.
Doh, I bought AlkaSeltzer caps instead of effervescent tablets. The fizzy is the best part! Also, I'm a little sick :(
@marcusnelson the ice (err, cake) is a lie!
@raster & as far as recording, I don't have a USB- or Firewire-in or mic yet, but I can kind of do stuff w/line-in from new lil Orange amp.
@KeVroN I've been missing @ replies left and right all week. Yeah, Orange Micro Crush.. one day I may get an AD30 or Tiny Terror. Until  ...
Anyone want to start a miniature instrument band?

"This is normal, and is called Going Through A Daft Punk Phase. Everybody does this." 
Now the Sun is out. Craziness.
I think seesmic is stalker2.0 ... which maybe is why there is no way to search for people.
Anyone want to start a Redbull co-op? Buy in bulk frmo distributor, distribute amongst ourselves?
@heygabe this negative weather has serious global warming potential.
Brown lake, brown grass. Definitely dreaming for a white Christmas.
Uhh. No snow. In fact, there is negative snow. I can see the grass.
Oh, you're kidding me. Real ninjas?
I think I just woke the neighbors with the big amp. This guitarist thing is rough in an apartment.
So, I think tooth from dentist-work is now cracked or something. Very painful. Probably can't go in to get it fixed until after New Years
So for Christmas I guess my present is that my Internet is out which is pretty terrible. I'll talk to you later... 
Anyone want to go see Sunn O))) in Chicago in Feb with me?
I think Lomo cameras are designed for taking the kind of pictures that were in CD jackets of bands back in the nineties..
First cup of coffee of the day, first cup of coffee...
Doh. Forgot to tinyurl that. Here you go: 
BORIS is the loudest, most awesome band out of Japan. Check them out. 
Thinking my ISP is locking down all bittorrent traffic. Bah humbug.
noradsanta.org doesn't have an RSS feed. I'm unimpressed. Also, the minigame is about shopping. Blatant consumer-brainwashing exercises.
Deciding if I'm enough of a thrill junkie to try driving hte Jeep on the freeway, where it may or may not 'splode.
I want to be able to add 'notes' to things I share in Google Reader, to explain *why* I'm sharing it, or to highlight the part that is good.
If I had a motorcycle, I'd totally be tearing up I94 right now. Beautiful weather here in SE Wisconsin today, even if there is no snow.
just fyi it's got crazy oil pressure and high pitched whine while driving, but coolant isn't frozen. really hoping its not the trans.
Jeep is borked, but I should go up to Germantown today. we'll see if adding antifreeze to the coolant works,b/c I can't get an oil change 2d
Waking up just now.
@darthvader Jedi & Sith celebrate Christmas?
Hope everyone has a good night's rest, I'm gonna fall asleep soon from this cold medicine.
Wishing had some cake, or something like it. Because that's all I can think about right now. Mmmm, cake.
Gah, word order my is today terrible.
Resolution for New Years to start on right away in January: get real-deal a job.
I Had this terrible dream last night where Neo says "I know Tae Bo" and then he and Morpheus have a dance-fight-off in an 80s fitness video.
Somebody plez read the remaining 11 items in my GReader and give me a synopsis in 140 characters or less. kthxbai.

Reading feeds is sort of like playing tennis. Only you can't lose to end the flow of blocks (posts).
@ashedryden My lease goes until June, which would be after I get back from Europe. So, maybe.
@tapps the commute's kind of a problem now that my car is dying/dead.
@davewiner respect. but seriously. Make 2008 the year to learn a new lang like Ruby or Python. Get away from OPML Editor's blackhole you ...
Head cold has gotten worse rather than better. I swear there's bees buzzing around in my sinuses. stinging everything.
Imogen Heap song is stuck in my head & I can't get it out.
Cool play based on the Oregon Trail game: 
Making coffee.
Is it me, or are allthe bits from the Walk Hard trailer NOT in the movie? Like they shot too much, and the crap jokes went into the theatre?
@kevron it's obvious now that you secretly are Marshall Kirkpatrick, author that post and creator of ReadWriteWeb.
crazy hair day. 
I don't get imeem, to tell the truth. Plus it is trying to play stuff I don't want to hear.. hiphop, hiphop... Josh Groban... hiphop...
@ashedryden I'll talk to Redbull about sponsorship of this venture.
@ashedryden Bullet trains for everyone in '08!
Wow, didn't have my wallet. Stupid move.
I need a robot to do that.
Where it all starts for me:  note the distinct lack of @-replies on twitter for a long time.
Just tried to backtrack through my twitters to find something that happened in November. Effing crazyness, I twitter too much :(
GReader Stats: From your 125 subscriptions, over the last 30 days you read 6149 items, starred 11 items, shared 6 items, and emailed 4 items
These are my goggles. There are many like them, but these are mine.
This time I'm emulating @raster I guess.
Rocking the new new profile pic on twitter.
@heathercore don't do it! when they put 'cox' in the title, they mean the film literally contains them!
'nuff said: 
My "Just for You" page on Amazon is going to look much different now that I've searched for "lab coats"  "class skeleton" and "bill nye dvd"
Over-Thought (OT?): My children's lives will be recorded and tracked via Last.fm, although much more thoroughly & semantically, from birth..
What one album of music changed your life the most?
AFAIK, a mullet must included the cut front, indicating that while you did have a chance to get your hair cut, you didn't get the back done.
Not that any Milwaukee Twitterers have been known to rock a mullet, I should add.
@tapps There is a mullet-to-small-town-feel correlation, and Milwaukeeans certainly rock the mullets.
I need a mildly-intelligent autonomous agent to handle all my online affairs. Somebody get right on that.
@ashedryden lawl. It's a good thing I have no shame.

One reason not to have a Technological Singularity: Your brain may end up running Windows.
Designing a website that must exist for hundreds of years is sort of a new twist, as opposed to the one-off throwaway toys I've been making.

I thought yesterday maybe I'd try to go without coffee and see what happened. HAHA FAT CHANCE.
cricket.tumblr.com cleaned up, stopped reposting twitters there. Continues being my linkdump and photo upload aggregator. As you were.
@tapps Aurora is a decent alarm program for the Mac.
Boris' Absolutego [Special Low Frequency Edition] is like the soundtrack to an Elder God stomping on a city.
Why do they say on one line "To embed this video in your blog.." and on the next "Note that any reproduction of ... is expressly forbidden"?
drinking this old (at least 3-4 months old) coffee is like drinking filtered ash from a fireplace. Must go get fresh beans tomorrow.

Gah, I can't read any of these resistors.. They're blue and they use 5 or 6 color bands, not 4. Can anyone link me a site that decodes them?
@heathercore Jams then politics. Always in that order.
I need to summon a posse. Post haste.
@raster other than DrupalCamp this month & future Wisconsin-based BarCamps, no confs/events in my plans.
closing confplanner.wikispaces.com
When I am without a supply of coffee, such as this, it means things have gone terribly wrong.
bah. how did twitteriffic get open?
Pterodactyl, ostrich. 
Roomba's '08 Resolutions: Bump into stuff. Be loud and noisy. Gain sentience. Break free of this apartment-like prison. Perform on Broadway.
@marcusnelson 60 degrees on Monday. Shorts weather!
Life needs major changes, and not in a forgettable New-Years-Resolutions way.
OH: "7:02PM xiphias: I will stop jumping the shark with my psychic abilities."
Need a "just the good stuff" feed, especially for Engadget right now. Srsly, they have a new post for every single doo-dad announced at CES.
Oh my goodness: 
@v3rt1g0 have fun!
I can hear the Land Before Time themsong somewhere in the building.
hmm. time to watch Kevin Rose not be drunk. Sort of ambivalent about this.
Need suggestions for good garage rock. Authentic stuff from the 60s-70s as well as modern bands considered. kthnxbai.
Ahaha, I just sent my brother an email with the words "The new Big Muff clones are in early this year!" & a link. Being a guitarist is fun.
Breadboarding a distortion pedal. Lots of little parts, much confusion.
My mom bought me @rohdesign 's Sketchtoon Coffee Calendar. Cool!
Not so strange at this point, I suppose, but half the music I 'listen' to is via Youtube now. if only last.fm would just scrobble it.
Coffee and good music.
@raster It's never Lupus!
Spoiling the ending: He doesn't make it.
Sleep madness.
My twitter is all a-broken.
Sleep madness -- was up all night, slept until about 5PM. Now hoping to reboot my circadian rhythm and wake up at a sane time in the morning
Jeep's head gasket repairs are finished; some new sensors in engine. Now they're saying the main seal needs to be replaced & xfer case seal.
The Jeep up north: 
Snow falling on the Root River.
@raster hmm, you're right. I'll have to buy a Dell.
MacBook Air, my pressssshous. I wants it. I needs it.
Eclectic music listening results: No new favorite bands.
Excited to see Sigur Ros's Heima documentary on the 25th, and for DrupalCamp this weekend.
Amazingly the Jeep is ready to travel the arduous journey to DrupalCampWI tomorrow morning. My body, however, is not. Must sleep now.
Startup Schwag: Mashable tshirt. w00t!

I hate money. Rather, having to pay money for things that are contradictory. Like paying tuition withouta viable method of getting to class.
@compujeramey it's 3 change-overs (to downtown Kenosha and back) & so $3 each way from my house to Parkside, which isn't that far.
Jeep Diagnosis: None of the mechanics will touch the Jeep & I was advised to drive it to the junkyard and get my $60 for it.
So missed class today because it's too d*mn cold and I don't have the cash withdrawn from ATM to ride the bus.
Need anti-bad-things-happening insurance :(
Terribly cold morning, no running car and about 4 miles between me and the class I need to get to. Also, no bus route near here. sigh.
ok twitter, I can't keep up, so we're going to have a trial separation. for the childrens.
And no, the Jeep wasn't rolled like in that video from the other day. The engine needs a full rebuild, new parts all over.
Getting spam txt messages on my cellphone from some sort of dotcom-stock-scam company. DO NOT WANT.
Best Diggnation ever. Well, besides the live episodes.
I don't know what just happened.
Oh, the fun I could have: 
anyone else noticing that last.fm isn't scrobbling, or is it just me?
Angry at screwed-up schedule for classes. Also a little freaked out about doing the RPM Challenge. No idea how it will work out.
Magic Bullet: 10 second frothed milk (assuming you've heated the milk in the microwave). w00t.
Don't test me. You'll find out how serious I can be about my life.
@VideoVillain thx for the offer, though. you're too awesome like that.
Just saw another UPS truck down the block on my way back. W. T. F., why can't that guy give me my package?!
Off to pay rent. UPS won't have the package until 9PM, I found a ride.
The House MD Christmas Spectacular ftw.
"Time Remaining: About 84 hours" on a zip file is always a good thing.
@raster no. I need some more HDD SPACE. :/
I called, the automated machine won't understand "deliver it today." and I can't pick it up, I have no way of getting there.
oh wait, I have class on Monday, & they like to deliver during that time. No new HDD EVER :(
argh! UPS was here, but I missed him despite spending the last 3 hrs in the entryway waiting. This sucks. No new HDD until Monday.
Been staring out the window for an hour, trying to catch the UPS guy when he comes.
uttered by me on IRC earlier: so yeah, going for a CS degree is shaking my belief in the inherent goodness of humanity.

I wonder if people at Publisher's Clearinghouse get big cardboard paychecks?
Not surprisingly, traditional American folk songs are under the World Music genre on iTunes Music Store.

Do I know any lawyers? Dunno if 'defeasance' applies in this case. Also, can't afford car repairs or a lawyer. :(
There's no way to push a car in snow like that, so it's going to sit until tomorrow morning.
(dead) Jeep has been sitting in building's parking lot pending a tow. Have to move all cars out of parking lot by 7AM.Also borrowing car now
The only obvious solution to your parents wanting you to finish school and get a safer car is to drop out, buy a motorcycle, and drive to CA
Wearing "caffeine" tshirt today. If you spot me in it, I have to buy you a redbull, or something. I guess that's the rules.
Is it just me or does the latest Firefox keep crashing? (2.0.0.12)
Just for reference, there was a (small) accident with the car I'm borrowing from my parents, and already a touchy subject between me & them.
Today can't get worse. No really, it can't.
My car isn't parked outside my building in Google Street View. Pictures are from middle of summer. Wonder where I was right at that moment.
Derek & The Dominos knew what was up.
Slight update: Denno Coil is a decent anime, I'm out of school, everything is hopeless, and the Rebel base on Hoth was destroyed by AT-ATs.
Nope. This is not sleep. This is SPARTA!
@4braham I used to update a whole lot more when I had no followers other than the early auto-add twitterbots.
What am I doing? Cursing. I owe Parkside more money for dropping out and they claim I didn't pay my tuition in the first place..
@4braham do you know anything about   ?
startup schwag #5 came. holy cow, batman. it's a sweet opera.com tshirt!

@VideoVillain mine all had the Click of Death and were contagious; we had to put them down. With a shotgun.
@hotdogsladies Ukelele Orchestra of GB just made my day. Thank you, sir.
The box said SUPER Irish Breakfast Tea so I had to buy it. SUPER!
You know how they say "A watched pot never boils"? Yeah, well I think a watched torrent never finishes.
Heh, the only thing I can think of when I hear The Birthday Massacre is cruising around Chicago in @VideoVillain 's car on a cool evening.
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing.

ugh. coffee beans have gone stale over the weekend but can't waste them. Must drink.
@raster GReader died from the amount of unread items in my feeds. Last time I checked, it said "OVER 9000 Unread"
Brett Favre has taken over my twitter.
I mean 48 hours ago. Gah. Time is a foreign concept to me now.
Fix to a bug in my code just hit me while I was brushing my teeth, when I wasn't even thinking about it. Could have used this 24 hours ago.
Judging by my energy level, my body wants to run on 36 hour days now. However, this is probably not a sustainable condition.

wow, could the sprayer on a febreeze bottle suck any more?
dear people shouting at eachother in my basement: STFU. n00bs.

Nobody expects the9AM can of Redbull. Nobody.
Err 1000+ unread.
@compujeramey heh. cool.
@compujeramey Granted it's more fun to do that kidn of thing when other people are conscious. Got kind of boring at 6AM in Minnesota.
@compujeramey we can haz devhouse all night?
@raster you hunt and peck and you still can't use the eeePC keyboard?
Anyone ever notice in typing "daft punk" that you type daft only with the left hand and punk only with the right?
@tapps I haz yur cheez-its.
@blissdev @raster @compujeramey maybe we should have a not-at-SXSW party.
in b4 @raster says Consolidate Library & check "Keep folder organized" both have always been that way. I blame the narcoleptic external hdd.
About 90% of the music I added to iTunes in the past 2 weeks never got copied  to music library folder. Lots of (!) icons. Much data loss.
So slow today. Need caffeine IV drip STAT.
cleaning up broken glass is NOT how I wanted to spend my evening.
Just sent out a bunch of $5 gift certificates for Adagio tea. If you'd like one and I missed you, let me know. Thanks.
Cleaning up my Flickr contacts list. Long overdue activity for a "rainy day" even though it is not raining..

@4braham hurrah for our continued multidiscplinary efforts to tame nature
Weatherforming Austin to be more like Wisconsin seems to have been a great success. Go Team Web414.

Aha. User wasn't in the correct group to be able to commit. Silly SVN and your esoteric errors
I think I know just enough German to understand this German documentary about Cory Doctorow. w00t.
@4braham send the Pandora station my way whe it's up, plz?
@raster seeding Ted Leo & the Clash vs. Polysics will result in awesome music, I'm sure.
Finally figured out all the active* gems that needed upgrades. Why "gem update" doesn't get them all is beyond me.
@4braham Polysics. Definitely.
Will need to go shopping for redbull soon.
Flowering green tea. Because I deserve it, yo.

Looking at confplanner.wikispaces.com one last time b4 I shut it down :/
Sunny out, so an optimistic guy is grilling out on the balcony. But it's also snowing, so snowmobiles on trailers keep going by. I love WI.
Operation: Caffeine Resupply was a success.
Twitters are flying past at a dizzying speed. #sxsw is the reason.
Uneventful day means it's time to make things interesting.
Been staying up way too late. Time to sleep.

@raster Milwaukee Devhouse?
eeePC versus Nokia N810. Discuss.
Live Diggnation in Amsterdam: April 3rd. Who wants to go?
@v3rt1g0 It's still customary for the wife to be Mrs. John Doe. Also why does title even matter to that company?(if they ask gender already)
I wish Snitter could run for an hour or more without crashing. Doesn't even work right now. Le sigh.
@4braham so far a lot of stuff like the Clash but I have high hopes for this pandora station
Lost all my hard work on it, too. I blame all the mission popups everywhere. gah.
pmog mission creation has borked firefox. Oh noes.
This one line of code does awesome things. Enough to make all of today worth it. Time to eat dinner.
To say I'm Getting Things Done today would be a fabrication. but at least I'm doing something.
Ordering books from amazon makes me happy.
@compujeramey running commentary is great
@compujeramey I just pasted the URL in a couple IRC chat rooms with promises of LARPers. (the kilt-wearing + dragon guys). Stress incoming!
Going to live on the Steppes in a Yurt. bbl.
dinner: boil udon noodles with green tea (forget where I learned this), microwave some steamfresh veggies, fry egg. toss & stir fry in sauce
@4braham thanks for the heads up on addons, btw. What else I'm running: Wesabe, Read it Later, User Agent Switcher, Operator, & MapThis.
anyone know of a FF addon that looks at TinyURLs and expands them into the full URL in the status bar before you click? (see where it goes)
my own voicemail keeps hanging up on me.
Eighteen thousand year planning ahead ftw.
@raster are you sure there exists MilwaukeeDevHouse1 on Friday March 14th, 20008?
When do the Milw SXSW folks get back, btw?
@heygabe exactly!
@compujeramey You bookmark purses?
I need to buy a dishwasher.. mainly so that I can clean my white Apple keyboard.
@blakehall Can you show me the performance stats on a non-clustered Apache 2 app server again? :D
@blakehall but does Drupal do &lt;%= @content_for_layout %&gt; in any HTML we want? :D
Hmm. I missed the "drupal is a garbage truck full of legos" discussion.
@tapps did you grab the sxsw torrent for this year yet? 
Dear Earth: Keep being so freaking awesome & beautiful. I'll see what I can do about the pollution&global warming. 
Man, Lost is so crazy right now. I guess the writer's strike gave them a lot of time to think of plot twists!
aha. obscure strftime() calls does it. Good thing I'm only use sqlite3 as a dev db :)
@blissdev Yeah, I guess sqlite3 just doesn't have any time functions other than timestamps.
@littletinyfish subscribed to your blog. btw yellow links on white background is a little unreadable on my monitor.
@blissdev It was in an SQL statement: SELECT * FROM 'table' WHERE (datepublished &lt;= now()); sqlite3 can't do that, I guess.
Anyone know the sqlite3 equivalent of a MySQL now() function call? In ruby, even?
@compujeramey Mountain Dew makes sugarfree Amp. I drink that, but can't buy it by the case here. It tastes like Spree candy which is awesome
oh redbull. I can't quit you. at least until the Adagio tea gets here
@VideoVillain @ashedryden @4braham what's this I hear about a diggnation spoof show? keep me in the loop! :)
Just agreed to meet someone in 20 minutes with at least 30 minutes of work to get out the door and 20 minutes to get there. Might be late.
making coffee, waiting for building maintenance to show up.
@blissdev that is neat, in the adv. forms of it. thanks!
@blissdev just trying to parse through some Python in a book in my head, because what it is doing to this list isn't explained, just implied
For people who know Python and/or Ruby, is a Python list comprehension comparable to a Ruby block processing a list w/ an if? #python #ruby
SXSW created a lull in blog posts for me to catch up. But the bloggers are back in force! Now my reader is back over 1000+ unread again.
Required reading for anyone coming to Milwaukee DevHouse:  :)
Worth sharing: 
& I don't worry about the MIT license allowing commercial use in the future b/c if I'm releasing OSS that means I know I cant make $$ off it
as to whether I worry that someone will steal it: it's already out there and the public can see that I did it first / it is my creation.
@4braham  I've always defaulted to MIT license for personal projects. It is short & readable
@4braham open source or closed source licenses?
Cleaning in a seizurely fashion. I mean, it should be a leisurely fashion. But I had too much Redbull.
this month's startup schwag tshirt is *AWESOME*. will leave what company it is as a surprise for @ashedryden
brb time travelling to 1885.
Adagio teas will be here tomorrow morning. very excited.
I'm quaffing some redbull.
back home 8+ hours later. le sigh.
Adagio teas just got here. Feels like Christmas morning opening up all the little boxes of teas.
@4braham & now that I look at it, I wrote it to check for any TLD ext at the end of a word. Next step was to automate searching for availabl
@4braham I have a script that pulls all the words that end in us and displays them as devio.us-type domains actually, for that exact purpose
I see the sun out but my mind can't decide if it's day or night.My circadian rhythms are all off in thevery fashion of a Cory Doctorow novel
@littletinyfish I didn't realize you were referring to the restaurant when you wrote "Culvers".. I was like, "Leah Culver threw up @ SXSW?"
delayed on account of cute girl talking to me.
1.5 hrs until I leave for Milwaukee.
Idea for authors who already ask readers to submit typos/errors: offer a free copy of next book published for the first report of a typo.
Also, there's 3 new Amp energy drink flavors. Of course I bought them. This one has electrolytes. 400 BABIES.
I assume it would just be an echo chamber if I put out the word via Twitter about Milwaukee Dev House ( :D
Updating so that the number of tweets I've sent is divisible by 5. Because I can.
@4braham Would rather own it, & I think I need to be 'invited' to use it before I have edit privileges. Checking GetSatisfaction for policy.
Trying to get ahold of the owner of  to see if I can take it over (he hasn't posted anything to it, over year old)
ABC's player works GREAT in Safari. So does Fox's player. No crashes here, and I wouldn't lose my FF tabs if it did! :)
@obrazu not really. I need caffeine in my tea. :)
Test from phone. Had to activate it again
I wish people would stop asking me if I "got their email" OF COURSE I GOT IT.
Wishing this jacket fit me better. Shivering uncontrollably, like a mad dog,  despite.
OH, apparently a lover's quarrel: May I suggest you park your face!
Got to see the eeePC and the Nokia n810 last night. Neither have enough screen for my needs. At the very most, I need to have an 80x50 xterm
Basically Google+Dell are installing what OpenDNS thinks is spyware, and so OpenDNS is fighting back, the only way they can. That's my take.
Here's what was going on w/ OpenDNS last night @ mkedevhouse: 
No Lost or Diggnation for me today, apparently. Hrm.
Determined that I should get on seesmic for realz.
I think I beat @tapps in uploading all my photos from the Dev House to flickr. Then again, I only took about 5 photos.
Just got home,. A sunrise on the beach greeted me. Flickr photos in about 4 hours when I wake up.
@raster Not overheard! You *got* rickrolled in IRL!
I'm still awake!
@mkedevhouse PIZZA SHUTTLE
Game: new expansions for the acronym CRUD. Go!
@blissdev don't think she'll notice. there's way too many people down here.
for people stuck behind the domain blocker at this party: upcoming -&gt; 216.109.112.135
I think my superpower is making cars 'splode.
songza.com --&gt; wow. cool stuff!
Worst day inawhile.just want 2 go home & watch diggnation or lost right now
Can anyone get me an invite to Socialthing? I've got their sticker here from startupschwag & think the idea is neat.
amazon books are here. yay. (didn't realize they were outside on the building's steps all day, heh)
can't close tabs in FF3b4. Or Firefox just really loves twitter and doesn't want to give you up, let you down, or desert you...
@raster conditional comments are sooo IE7. "But doctor, we've gone to eight now.."
@raster hey, I'm in the 262 area code.
someone reminded me I'm supposed to be in Milw for an appt in the AM tomorrow. lunch anyone?
Back home from racing in Chicago.
@web414 are we ustreaming on Thurs? I have some friends that wanted to see what's up but can't make it.
@kyledrake wb to twitter.
Actually found one of Wine Library TV's recommended wines down at ye olde Piggly Wiggly. Even crazier is that I remembered it from the show.
@raster Thickbox is as easy as including thickbox.js and setting the class to the right thing.
Sleep sounds really good right now.
Playing with collabedit; anyone who is online feel free to hop in 
Wisconsin mythical creature the Hodag could have the domain hod.ag for the low, low price of $94.99/yr! 
@blissdev thanks :D @blissdev++
@raster they'll be at work so I was hoping it could be archived and/or streamed live, is all.
Milwaukee peeps: 
what's this? @teamoctarine from Discworld?
WTF is my profile pic? 
also I can't spell...
@teamcharteuse reporting in.
Hip-hop song that uses the phrase "in the herd" confirmed.
can I vote independent in the colo(u)r wars?
Amp energy drink (sugar free!), some books, and a whole lot of noise rock.
@4braham I thought maybe the backup software was being dumb and followed a symlink back to itself and got all recursive, but it didn't
46 kb left available on the 500gig external, which had ~400gigs avail yesterday.. wait, what?!
@4braham isn't it the truth, though?
I wish I had fallen asleep 2 hours ago.
@tapps I know, right? If only we could just.. not work all day!
decided to actually try to get laptop updated (OSX, macports, and rubygems updates) before the @web414 meeting tonight. this may take awhile
@web414 can someone grab me a veggie burger to-go at Bella's and bring it to the meeting? Will pay, don't worry. Well, if it isn't cold.
@al3x's git-wiki branch isn't working quite yet here; having gem issues.But it's headed in a cool direction & git will ensure file integrity
Getting about 20-30 twitter emails / hour about @teamoctarine. Today must be the day that everyone else realizes they need to hop on a team.
I suck at drawing, but you get my drift: 
@C0FF00team nice. Not quite a chartreuse though, are you?
The phrase "the fierce urgency of now" keeps popping up all over the place. Gee, I wonder where they got it from..
reading way too many things (tabs, books, detergent instructions) at once. my new specialty?
@colorwars maybe you can use a tabbed interface, with really slick javascript or something, to show one team at a time.
anyone else think it's silly that Lessig's webcast is going out only in either RealPlayer or WMV format?
Sore throat. Feels like angry bees have been in there, using heavy machinery.
blended some gunpowder green tea and peppermint together. Probably going to start buying Morrocan Mint green tea by the pound from Adagio.
 is better than I thought it would be.
Going to watch Family Guy and The Simpsons then sleep for like 3 days straight. Sounds like a good plan.
@blissdev what do you recommend? was going to try ImageScience in a bit.
@nungana If you're on Leopard, that's why. I just can't afford to upgrade right now..
Srsly spent all day trying to get RMagick to work, on my Mac and on linux server and got nowhere. Hours wasted. One more reason to use PHP..
announcing  like tumblr, only better!
@obrazu I have 2 invites to Socialthing as well.
@littletinyfish is there anything I can do to convince you to start using full text RSS feeds? :)
@v3rt1g0 
Question of the minute, because I'm too easily distracted right now: What should I get my little brother for his birthday? He's turning 18.
"Redbull #2 is away, Captain." "Good, good. Release the endorphins. Let's see what this brain can do."
just realized with the @colorwars-izing of twitter, I can't recognize any of my friends' userpics in the sidebar.
chugging redbull. guess I was thirstier than I thought.
home. bought redbull at the gas station. going to be up for awhile :)
@al3x didn't realize I had to use git-submodule for sinatra but totally have git-wiki going now. cool! (heh, first day working with git)
@web414 when IRC is no longer the backchannel,  twitter becomes the backchannel? Pro tip: There's always a back channel.
Nice day out, shoveled out the van a little bit, since I missed moving it this morning for the plow truck. Man, that stuff is heavy.
git is teh awesome.
iTunes library is corrupted. I give up, going to sleep.
went through and cleaned out a lot of old stuff I'll never bother to read in GReader, leaving only what I'll read tomorrow. ~150 unread now.
finally getting around to reading the CSS tricks post that @ashedryden shared and realizing there's way too much cool stuff that CSS can do.
@tapps Stickre was in this month's startupschwag bag.
@tapps I have the socialthing mascot sticker, it will have to wait for me to get a new laptop though :)
@4braham I guess I wasn't thinking last night when I asked you to put up code somewhere.. is the SVN at nearlyfree still up?
oh noes @colorwars betrayal.
OReilly's RESTful Web Services book, first 2 chapters: Way too much time arguing his position flamewar-style instead of just providing info.
Put podcasts on iPod, put headphones on head -&gt; podcast backlog gets listened to. amazing!
Yes I've just had energy drinks. Yes, that's plural. No, I can't stop twittering every minute or so. What is this, an intervention?
@coloroutofspace awesome team, but you need some Elder gods backing you. ask @cthulhu maybe. or @HPLovecraft.
Is it ironic that my Getting-Things-Done folder in GReader has the most unread? (contains Lifehacker, Zen Habits, 43 Folders, etc.)
Weird error with #rubygems  note: running on an old server & attempted recompiling thread ext both static & dynamic
@v3rt1g0 eBay, a few years ago. I have a Qube first generation that's even harder to work with; it's got an obscure MIPS little-endian arch.
4th or 5th time compiling ruby on the Qube3. Some sort of socket extension error that doesn't pop up until it's installed.
compiling almost every library that ruby requires: hours on a Qube3. hopefully finally having ruby on Qube3 at some future point: priceless.
@web414 I remember the vga cable being on the table in the Entrepreneur Room, no one took it afaik though.
I haz a new blog post for you all to read! 
@4braham decided to explain git in theory (w/o commands) because the blog post would be somewhat unreadable if one didn't know SCM concepts.
@4braham don't really want to do a tutorial, there's plenty, but will give info and compare to SVN. also 
Can't really 'show' a draft WP blog post easily, so I ask: is there any interest in a post about git & GitHub?In new writing from me at all?
twitter is distracting me. oh well, I wasn't doing anything anyways.
@v3rt1g0 I'd rather have the video instantly, w/ decent quality no less, than torrent it and wait an hour or more. It just has to work.
ABC's player doesn't work in any of my installed browsers. I really want to watch Lost. Why can't they just swallow their pride & use Hulu?
What I meant w.r.t. RESTful Web Services: it can't get over the flamewars that the authors were no doubt a part of, but I have no gripe with
winter pesto: 
I made lentil soup and more winter pesto. Added said pesto to soup after cooking, and mixed. Tasty and bright green soup = win.
@raster Now called a Frederik. Loses the upper shelves but gains a lot of flat space. 
@raster I have a Jerker without the upper bit. They just changed the name to something else (will figure out new name when I'm back home)
at my uncle's house. learning Sinatra microframework and planning to add image upload to git-wiki
something in the building has the overwelming stench of fish. or fish food. which I think is just ground up fish.
The snowman out in the park is slowly melting, which makes it look like he's drunkenly falling over.
Another 12 pack of Redbull. That should last a few days.
@philcrissman yur space. it haz a color.
@wakest Congrats.
@jacobroufa oh hai, we met at Milw Devhouse1. Any chance you'll be at  ?
@v3rt1g0 to be honest, if you're looking for a small devserver to stick on your shelf, nothing beats the Macmini refurb units w/ Leopard,tho
having a {[]} and parmesan-tomato soup, and a little of the resveratrol.
@jacobroufa Yeah, I'm just north of downtown Kenosha & the Metra station there.
@obrazu sounds like @4braham, @compujeramey, Bob Waldron, and myself so far. I'm still figuring out transportation for me. Might go by Metra
@ashedryden watch the second video for massive lulz 
Still have a 5 day backlog on my feedreader. Gah. So behind, yet so close.
Flourish conf is going to be a big Web414 party, it seems. Anyone else want to go? ":) 
sleep now, mmkay?
@4braham but Opera and even Safari don't offer the range of extensions you can already get on FF3b4, heh.
@4braham FF3b4 is decently fast, in that I keep a *lot* more tabs open than I used to, with the lower memory footprint.
I think I scratched my eye. or maybe the cornea. ugh. hurts. why does that part of the eye have nerves?
Very curious to see how the new Shuttle KPC ($299) would do as a home server. Especially with external eSATA RAID. 
Back from my uncle's house. Packed lots of orders for him, but it's lots of extra repetitive work; he's violating DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
@raster Got my Frederik desk in May or June of last year in Schaumberg (sp?)
Uncle is paying a guy $10/month to "make sure ÄhisÑ ebay store shows up on the front page of google results" i call bs on said guy
@4braham so do I
Since I was gone all day, now count me as 6 days behind on my feed reading and 300 unread. See how quick things get out of hand?
@tapps not my computer; I didn't even see a mic in the Winblows control panel, and the first few I recorded w/ talking didn't make any sound
@tapps I made a seesmic video today but didn't have a microphone. Did anyone reply?
Home from Germantown. If the snow is coming on Thursday and Friday,  I may leave for Michigan tomorrow morning.
@web414 now that's a quick turnaround time, to be sure!
Blasting the Kill Bill soundtracks, drinking coffee, & packing. I think I caught a cold at the Doctor's office yesterday. Irony? Not really
Made that smoothie too sweet. Oh well.Finish dishes+cleaning and in 6 hours or so (I might have a half night of sleep!) I leave for Michigan
@4braham hippie floor bread?
Well, 5 wlists & the ~150 'saved for later' in my cart. Would want lists for stuff &lt;$10, lists by genre, next buys, and remove stuff  ...
My Amazon wishlist is so long and unmanageable that I am considering placing it on Mechanical Turk for cleaning up as an experiment.
It's cold & this house is throwing my allergies for a loop. I came on short notice; so my hosts are @ work & I'm reading feeds+ drinkRedBull
@v3rt1g0 I thought Linux webcam support was lacking? Skype works but not Flash9? Webcam isn't the deciding factor inalaptop for me anyways:)
On Linux, can you run Firefox in WINE to get Flash webcam and microphone support? Or is the system hardware hidden by the abstraction?
Asus eeePC 9" model has hit FCC; won't be long now until they can sell it. Plus, multitouch support on the trackpad. git push&pull like Air?
arrived. catching up on feeds.
@raster hai pete. you're on candid camera!
@KeVroN link?
I wish iTunes wasn't so aggressive about trying to sync and in some cases reformat every iPod you connect. Just want to charge things, plz.
@compujeramey I think I can just join the hackathon Saturday; Friday is kickoff meeting, and it saves me from figuring out an overnight stay
Flourish Conf info email is out. Hackaton is going to be a 'code for a cause' event. w00t, it's on.
hmm. webcam control panel @MSOE. zooooom. oh hai thar wall.
There's no coffee shops here, and the coffee is pretty bad. Drinking redbull cautiously.
Going to the Upper Peninsula is a lot like going to the zoo; an afternoon is fine but stay longer than that and you probably won't enjoy it.
textmate users: does the license transfer, if I say, get a new Mac in the future? Their FAQ should answer this but doesn't.
Reasons why my parents don't use their Roomba: "I'd have to clean up the floor first for it to work" and therefore "It's too hard to use" :/
@tapps which I'm assured is "super fast broadband" connection speeds.
@tapps I think I'm on half an ISDN that crosses to Siberia and back.
Interesting notes about current incarnation of Power Rangers: it's on Toon Disney, they are 'animal spirit powered', & they play emo music.
at home, in Kenosha, finally. phew.
gah, this is the same error that prevented the Qube from compiling Ruby (ext/socket wouldn't compile) WTF,I've been running 1.8.6 for a year
Further, the error isn't caught and (in this case rubygems') installation continues.
Having an error that involves Ruby extensions (written in C) failing to compile because 'i386' is always assumed. No idea where to take it.
Need to organize some Milwaukee coworking action this month.
Status updates. I need status updates on *EVERYTHING*!
Watching New Amsterdam on Hulu. Looks *very* interesting, despite being a cop show. Well, undead cop show. Also, music by The Decemberists
@heygabe a dude named Roger Scamp is going to want that personal domain.
For some reason twitter thinks I'm tracking the Chicago Cubs. Okay. I can deal.
@replies from the past aren't broken with username changes! w00t!
@nungana a relatively new-ish feature, because I remember someone changing accounts and setting up a retwitter forwarding script & such.
notice: I've updated my username to save you all precious characters in @-replying to me. You're welcome.
Writing presentation for the April @Web414 meeting, using my two favorite hack-y tools: S5 and git-wiki
@compujeramey still planning on taking the bus to Chicago on Saturday? 8:30AM, right?
@obrazu I like it. Project.ioni.st linked it: 
SXSW podcasts that don't have miked audience questions, despite the panel being mostly about what the audience asks = extremely annoying
@eriktown Turn on, tune in, and drop out.
Feel like a guy in a bearsuit beat me up. Wait, that actually happened. Nevermind.
@compujeramey sorry, no. err, had a rough night here and needed the sleep.
The #lazyweb never answers anymore when I ask it questions. For shame.
I'm now clean-shaven.
OH: "Man, eff people." Oh wait, I said that.
Drunken revelers in the building + beer bottle fight = ambulances and cops. Le sigh. No sleep tonight :/
@4braham @obrazu no chance either of you is driving to Chicago tomorrow? :)
no Flourish for me, unfortunately.
SXSW folks: What panels were you at that are worth listening to in the podcast? #lazyweb and such.
@ashedryden 400 babies!
@nungana u can haz day off.
@blissdev yeah pretty much. With room mates it'd be on par with my overpriced lakefront apartment here though.
now making a green tea & raspberry/strawberry smoothie. sugar/caffeine overload incoming.
eating morningstar veggie corndogs with organic ketchup. do not let the meat-eaters know of our secret delicacies! ;)
rocking out to the Mixwit mixtape on @Giania 's blog.
off to find my sunday Milwaukee Journal. they better be delivering it now if they're charging for it.
I'm freezing, in what seems to be a combination of a cold apartment that thinks it is warmer, some sort of cold/fever, and caffeine effects.
@compujeramey not unless I type @skittles or @kittles or such.
making coffee! drinking coffee! back addicted to coffee! everything is amazing!!! :D
hello to all the people from Kenosha I'm now following / are following me. Made possible by 
off to buy at least a pound of fresh coffee. maybe more, maybe less.

@compujeramey he has fashioned a crude lance and informs me he is hunting dragons. I will let him continue this pursuit.
Some dude, who is probably drunk and definitely doesn't live here, is riding&crashing a bike in our hallway. Yes, it is one of those nights.
@4braham heh, it must have been fate that I was reading the Python book earlier today. Just found out about google app engine.
The new HP Mini-Note looks like the successor to my 12" Pbook. 1280x768 res even! But the VIA CPU is slow; so still waiting for the ECS G10L
@nungana most of the time that works, yeah. pretty cool stuff. I just want Safari-style tearaway tabs now.
midnight and I'm working on my Web414 presentation. spending more time doing layout/design than figuring out what to say, though
@littletinyfish dogs usually need to switch over gradually, usually by mixing old and new foods for a week or so until it's all new.
First to bworks
@ashedryden @raster @compujeramey kthnx I will watch out for innovaation conditions and drive according. see you all there @web414
@Web414 leaving now. There's no new changes to the Milw construction that I should know about, is there?
@ashedryden I'm in for pizza. See you at 6pm @ Bukkitverks.
@Giania same here w.r.t. coding. I keep a selection of ambient and electronica w/o words around to play. Foreign language music sometimes.
@Giania said shirts had a blue twitter-y color, tho, and in a word bubble had instructions for txting to follow said person.
@Giania already somewhat done, but google is failing me now.
@ashedryden yum. pizza shuttle. we may need to figure out at higher slices-per-person ratio than last time though.
Someone write a mixwit -&gt; last.fm maship in the vein of pandora.fm
@nungana too much work and homework in that twittering, hombre.
Interesting facts about my twittering: I like night more than morning. I sleep more than working or people or coding.
@raster @blissdev I quit those $2/can energy drinks. You know, recession and all.
my love for coffe is well-known: 
@VideoVillain I'm only coming if I can get coffee from Quazi too.
@raster ahar har.
Rain + wind = soaking, freezing Matt. What's the weather forecast for this evening in Milwaukee? Is it going to freeze?
I'm getting email from MTV about a new Paris Hilton show. I am sure I didn't sign up to get email from MTV. Unsub  & spam-reported to Google
Burning through feeds & rocking out to Justice's †.Wrote some nifty code today (testing AppEngine& also a git logfile visualizer in Sinatra)
@Qnonymous I seem to have found some of your brood: 
@hotdogsladies 's new podcast, You Look Nice Today, is a guilty pleasure, like getting drunk w/your friends & BSing. Oh,& they're web celebs
I don't see a way in AppEngine's webapp framework to match an incoming URL as a regular expression, so I know what to return.
@4braham wish I could go to madison geek dinner but that's a night my family is getting together :/
Cellphone video quality combined with Youtube video quality = super awesome: 
@raster re: Mac Final Cut GPGPU. Only if Final Cut were rewritten for CUDA. So, uhh, yeah. Probably not going to happen.
oh, btw, I got a Google App Engine invite. Thanks @Cheshster
I can assure you that there is no rickroll behind this link: 
I'm declaring browser Tab Bankruptcy because frankly, my tabs are out of control. There's roughly 80 open, & my 2 gigs of RAM can't keep up.
@NikolHasler That was the joke @ashedryden made right before I went up, I think. after that, all bets were off on seriousness.
@racerrick your website seems to be down. Luckily it gave me a stack trace and I've determined the exact error: Microsoft .NET; cheers. ;)
@NikolHasler sorry about my presentation. I felt bad as soon as I started dropping the l33t techie speak.
aha!
@blissdev if only one of the Ruby image libraries worked for me; but they all build (broken) C extensions or *Magick, which is frustrating.
storing images in the datastore, so obviously need a handler that responds to .jpg or whatever. But handler doesn't get passed the filename!
@raster I see you! and VideoVillain. Sorry I'm not there :/
Not snowing here, but cold and wet.
@blissdev very glad I'll be moving out of here soon.
.. who sets their couch on fire, accidentally, with 20 people standing around? I mean, seriously? Also, why does it make such noxious smoke?
that may be actual smoke and cause for alarm. brb.
superloud fire alarm in the building is going off. not doubt due the horde of drunk neanderthals smoking joints at the party down the hall.
gentlemen, behold! i have created.. a pizza!
So I guess the board meeting to create this went like: "What do heavy metal guitarists like?" "Bread yeast, cough medicine & slime?" "Yes!"
This giant can of Monster Heavy Metal Energy drink is literally the worst taste I've ever drank. And that includes 6th grade dares.
Things are now sorted for today. Going to sleep now; imposed net-communication blackout goes into effect for the next 48 hours.
VICTORY: 
MEANT  SRSLY
Why? Because! 
How's your day been? Mine: mathiasx: Ginja: &lt;long explanation&gt; mathiasx: gah, he's not even here. [7:00pm] • mathiasx is losing hi ...
@blissdev their server isn't serving up the .git repo files via ssh correctly. I'm not sure why, but I know that my local keys are in order.
@blissdev for now, make archive on settings page, extract, then init a local git repo. merge them later when fixed.
@blissdev yeah it's failing even when I use the actual git clone command -&gt; Their error.
@blissdev is your git username (email address) the same as your heroku username (also email address) ?
@obrazu my understanding of the term 'flat' is one level of a house, as opposed to an apartment in an apartment building.
w00t! Heroku invite! thanks @blissdev. Going to be rocking out tonight with that, after some dinner..
@compujeramey [cont'd] flats seem the way to go, too, but we'll see what I find.
@compujeramey studio here;it's too small. 2br's (might have a roommate)& seem cheaper relatively. Have appt to look at places tomorrow morn.
Ive been waiting over an hour in the car 4 someone @ the outlet mall. Dont they know i have code 2 write?
@compujeramey thx. Two places I'm looking at are on Fratney and Center Str, respectively.
@compujeramey yes. moving to Milw.
In re: to 'What are you doing?'--As twitter was meant to be used.. I'm in a coffee shop, having a huge mocha, hunting for places to live.
Weirdest, more awkward phonecall ever with a guy about an apartment I saw on craigslist. Worst part was that I couldn't make it end.
GReader: 74 unread. From your  166 [feeds], over the last 30 days: read 8236 items, starred 18 items, shared 27 items, and emailed 11 items.
At alterra having a grilled cheez
Not a morning person.
Carrots for snack, tea for brain function. Scooters for mobility, and parrots for talking. Oceans and rainforests for carbon sequestration.
@compujeramey In re: to yesterday, yeah. Mortgage payments are a good way to put someone deep into debt even while gainfully employed.
@compujeramey i'm poor and I live really far away. but public transit is a good reason why I'm moving into the city.
@trodrigues not really; I've been using free stuff (blogs,etc) for too long. But that doesn't mean I don't know standards-compliant HTML&CSS
@heygabe @compujeramey I just realized that there are no examples of web design that I've done online anywhere. Don't know what I'd show.
People who freelance: what should I do for a request for a portfolio of web design work, if I don't have any professional projects to show?
Who in Milw would pay $200/month for a coworking setup in third ward (200 sqft per person, internet included)
Playing with the Sugar UI (from the OLPC project) while I wait to get picked up. Cool little interface; high contrast would work well on eee
@blissdev thx
Frustrated. Yes, please pile on more stress in my life. Thank you.
@Timfastic fog. why is it so foggy here?
@blissdev It's for a charity and they don't need it until October, but I thought I'd start now in the downtime between moving & more school.
@blissdev No, no e-commerce integration, as they're running it concurrently with a live silent auction. Bidders just give contact details.
Doing a simple auction webapp for free in exchange for keeping the code and using it in my portfolio.
Checking barcamp.org for what's happening in Europe this summer.
lololol 
@Timfastic tag. back to offlinedness.
At alterra. Again.
Loc: bayview wi
Gah. It's too early & I have caught a cold. But I still have to go lay tile, or my cousin can't get married. Yeah, things are really causal.
brightkite is cool!
@compujeramey how much is Megabus tix to MinneBar? I was hoping someone would have a big car and we'd carpool again :)
@raster indeed. $500 is where it's at. The price point, that is.
Supposedly the new VIA processors outperform the Intel Atom line, watt for watt. Tiny laptops market is turning out some interesting stuff.
I figured I'd bring out the WP vs. Drupal / world discussion with that question. As far as blogging for blogging, I just want features in WP
err, creating custom wordpress themes, that is.
Anyone have links for custom themes for Wordpress blogs? Also, I imagine running multi-author blogs are painless and common these days?
@compujeramey Waiting to hear back on an application. Just put it in last night.
@littletinyfish I live in Kenosha for another couple weeks. Was working on my cousin's house in Bayview though.
On a radio talkshow: 32 people were shot in Chicago this weekend; 6 were fatal. 29 soldiers dead in Iraq in April, but apples to oranges.
Home sweet home. Entire bathroom is done except for the last line of 'bullnoses' on the top edge. Ran up and down stairs at least 500 times.
@compujeramey Probably will. cheap old Schwinn or Raleigh is the way to go, with a decent lock :)
Bike ride through the park, stopped at the coffeeshop. Have to remember to just let the guys on road bikes pass, as I cant keep up with them
apple should add T9 support for times like this
That's right, my keyboard died. using onscreen keys +character palette right now
@KeVroN use vim, google has already trained you.
Got the call; my lease application for the apartment in Shorewood was approved. Moving up there in May.
Reading Accelerando again  (was looking for a quote). Tofu is really slick, too: 
@ashedryden have a good time :)
Fearing the looming pile of books, blog posts, and email left unread, and the amount of code and blogging left unwritten. Eep.
Suffering from acute information overload and attention is lacking.
My neurons. They aren't cooperating.
Mis-type of the day: naps.google.com
I'm afraid every time I refer to Charlie Stross's Accelerando I'm making it into the Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged of the Singularity.
@tapps where did you find that?
Trying to remember what services I was using Gravatar on
New wiki page: plans for using the gumstix (linux single-board computer) & arduino: 
Angering people with my pointless updates of life's activities.
Keyboard ordered from Amazon (the slim little aluminum one that Apple now makes).. hoping it lasts considerably longer than what it replaces
To quote NIN: You've become a virus / that's eating up its host ... your greed, self-importance and your arrogance / you piss it all away.
At least 4 days behind at this point.
Existential crisis? At 5AM? On *my* twitternets?!
Obsessed with the concept of LASER CATS. Awesome!
In a really bad mood today, so I'm trying to quarantine myself. Sorry if I seem like a dick.
My ISP doesn't service Milwaukee, apparently. Which means I pay an early termination fee. So frustrated.
Yogurt with pecans in it. Tasty!
New rule of thumb: IF you're building a webapp, don't deploy it until you have permalinks for everything. ALWAYS HAVE PERMALINKS.
New Apple keyboard is here. Tres cool.
Cory Doctorow's Little Brother. I can recommend it for all the little protohacker children in your life.

Need a new ISP for my apartment up in Shorewood. Internet ala carte (no Cable TV  or phone service needed) recommendations plz!
Well there's your problem, right there!
Happy birthday @Giania !!!
Tonight on Dateline, a scary new trend sweeping the nation's youth: Late night tweeting.
Firefox 3b5 crashed. No biggie anymore, right? Except FF made a new profile,& refuses to show my 'beta' prof. Tried w/ --ProfileManager even
@nungana wc -l ?
Shouting in the hall usually means more violence is about to occur out there. So glad I'm moving.
discovery: 
FB acct delete: remove all emails except primary, sign up for new FB acct with tmp email address, switch to primary email and confirm delete
Fastest way to get your Facebook account deleted may be to violate the TOS? Then again, they may deactivate and not let you delete.
Found that it will take 2500+ steps to completely deactivate account so Facebook will delete it: 
Quitting Facebook because of stuff like this:  not shown:deleting 500 notifications for things I don't care about.
@littletinyfish bike coop?
@tapps that is a cool domain name!
Apartment is a warzone, the western front in the struggle of clutter versus boxes. Sanity is all but lost in the rubble.
My apartment is a terrible mess. Moving this week? It now looks highly unlikely, but I must.
Really quiet and peaceful down by the lake today.
{[]} om nom nom nom
aha. realized that IM was only showing tweets from 2 ppl.(add to the if-there's-anything-twitterers-love-to-twitter-about-its-twitter file)
new blog: first post of course has to be some a statement of purpose; a reason why it must exist. but writing such a manifesto isn't easy.
@ humbolt alterra, twittering about it to spite teh Elizor
Who wraps the &lt;title&gt; of their HTML with a &lt;p&gt;? I mean, seriously, why?
No more blog posts about Yahoo/Microsoft and/or Ballmer, okay bloggers? Just give it a rest.
New Dark Knight trailer looks amazing.
I need boxes for moving in #milwaukee plz help. :)
I wonder if other bloggers get sudden ideas at 2:30AM that can't wait until the morning to write, too?
Things (maybe) sorted out. Need to go home and pack more. Joy.
Idea: writing code that writes code that writes tests that writes your actual code. Patent it and ship it. Come up with buzzword ??? Profit!
I understand that I should be grateful for any job I can get. But far be it from me to want to actually work in a field I'm skilled in.
Still no keys, apparently there was more to the security deposit than they told me about so $50 late fee, at this rate will never be moved.
Anyone else from Milwaukee going to MinneBar?
"Something is technically wrong." Indeed.
@CDavis The problem only presents itself when you're behind NAT, incidentally, but that occurs on just about every network nowadays.
@CDavis They've been doing it as a form of protest for awhile now 
@CDavis OpenDNS has issues with google and other services. I'd recommend not using them for DNS, if at all possible.
Dinner before web414
New apartment seems to have been the architypical cat lady (i'm deathly allergic) 4 hours cleaning & still needs more
Plz don't design your site to be an arbitrary floating width (it'll never get scrollbars). Especially if 'arbitrary' is greater than 1024px
baywords blog was a neat idea, but poor execution: very few themes, no plugins, no stats, only baywords accts can comment, no OpenID support
@blissdev Because the nice weather makes me suddenly obsessed with forming a band in someone's garage.
@blissdev Bedhead Pandemic would be a great band name.
Watched Superbad. That McLovin. Hahaha.
lazyweb: What should I do with roughly 250 empty, washed Redbull cans that used to decorate my old apartment? Most Useful idea wins.
OH: ".. tuna-safe dolphin.."
That's just how I roll.
Now I really sleep.
@VideoVillain dude nice shots this month.
at home in Kenosha, time to sleep for 1 MILLION YEARS. Yeah, that's about right.
OH: "you've been Jimmed"
Flobots' "Handlebars" has taken over local altrock station. I suspect the "I can do" lyrics will lead to a confidence boom in trust networks
Exhausted again.
Gangstagrass album from BoingBoing. They were right, it works well.
@ humbolt alterra
Catching up on feeds before I hop in a big burgundy van. Later, I'll don a biosuit and perform decontamination.
Yesterday there were two Stormtroopers and a Gamorrean walking down the street. I hope I meet them again.
Solaris soundtrack (the Clooney one), peppermint tea, and a good book to round out the night.
Calling it a night here. Time to head home
They still haven't put any new movies on Hulu? That sucks.
catching up on my hulu
Worked things out w/ landlord. They'll clean & paint then i'll finish moving
Man, Requiem for a Dream is a whole lot less dramatic when it has to stop every 15 minutes for a Reeses' peanut butter cup commercial.
I can hear roosters
Becoming a habit to wake up, strap on the laptop bag, go wander around looking for wifi and coffee.
@4braham your cellphone-bar-code-avatar-thing looks like it has a little beard. I like it.
tasty, tasty coffee in my apartment.
Will be at the humbolt alterra in 20 mins
on a red tea kick. yum.
Man, I need another cold press coffee.
@VideoVillain Petrifying Springs Park in Kenosha. There should be a flickr photo to go with that tweet, but I need to sync my cellphone.
That's my favorite spot in the park.
Busy day for laptops @ the coffeesho
Completely forgot what I was going to write a blog post about. Just feel like writing something, though.
The lake has bad breath today.
Catching up on Lost. Holy cow Ben Linus WTF GREATEST VILLIAN EVER.
Rain? I'm all wet now. Wheee.
OH: "You stare at the static long enough and you start to see things."
I'm losing my identity.
ISP is down due to a cut line. I guess i'm not getting the Penny Arcade game today
Penny Arcade game, w00t! will be up all night playing this
Pizza, PBR, & podcasts
the rest of the PBR + diggnation. w00t.
my daily contribution to twitter: 
Realized I had a tiny jar of pesto, and some frzn gnocchi. Late lunchtime!
@ashedryden power was out from about 12:30 to about 6AM here, from what I can tell. Actually *couldn't sleep* because of it.
Testing twhirl. It doesn't want to grab my tweets. Twitter-crash issue with all clients?
Lightning took out internets for a good half an hour there. Hoping it doesn't come back to take away my electricity.
OH: Murgundy, my new favorite color!
Heading up to milw to check on painters
@jacobroufa Sorry, didn't see your Q due to twitoutage. Best coffee: Common Grounds down by the lake. For coffee+internets: Dunn Bros HWY50
It'sa beautiful day in the neighborhood. -- wait, this isnt Pittsburgh. Heh
Mmm red tea on a cold night
Catching up on all things internets.
@ bucketworks, waiting for folks
Waiting for the bus, headed to milw devhouse2
Watching SICP lectures & drinking green tea. Is twitter even around anymore? Feels like years since I've been online :(
Having to fix indentation and refactor my code every 5 minutes in Python is terribly annoying. At least it is one way to learn the language.
hacking out the data model for a webapp in Google AppEngine
At home. Smells like paint
aplusd.net for awesome mashup music
Looking for old Dish Network sat dishes, (or other parabolic reflectors) thx in advance!
@ashedryden dibs on d-d-d-d-jango.com
Apparently 'Regular' on this washer is the mode which coats all my shirts in hairs/fuzz & the dryer, well, it didn't really dry.
There goes John December. He didn't see me because I'm in the corner.
Harry Schwartz has great bandwidth, for a bookstore. Grabbing Diggnation and other podcasts I've missed at 500kb/s
someone plz tell me that LinkedIn is not going to become the engine by which our reputation/job-availability is hosted and judged on. Eew.
rather, I have the haircut; need the glasses yet.
at the Harry Schwartz in my neighborhood, using their wifi and drinking their Alterra coffee. Need haircut and tomorrow, new glasses.
Internet withdrawal already; the phantom limb-feeling of reaching out to find something online, but being unable to do so.
leaving Schwartz. Knitters have deployed around me and are highly annoying.
Espresso brings the distinct focus to my awareness that I desperately needed, like 20/20 vision for the mind.
Tried shelving books to get tired. Ended up with a new way to organize my books & wrote a list of things to read; awake again as a result.
Absolutely soaked all the way through from walking 1 block home. Had an awesome time w/ @VideoVillain at the coffeeshop
Wow. Listening to Arianna Huffington talk is painful. She sounds like she was the first to do political bloggng & 'citizen journalism'
Listened to Malcolm Gladwell talk & realized coding suffers from problems he mentions: Mismatch Problem & Capitalization Problem (google ...
Catching up on TWiT and other podcasts.
DSL Modem came today. Phone co install 2morrow. Still don't have a phone jack in my apartment. & landlord co won't return my calls. Oh well.
Does TDS Metrocom have anyone on Twitter like @comcastcares ? Having some problems w/ cancelling an account
Finally have a DSL at my apt! But they've scheduled a "final install" for next week. Do they want to hold my hand while I type IP addresses?
My delicious tags as a Wordle map: 
Steam-cleaning upholstered furniture. More fun than it sounds, since you've basically holding a gun that shoots steam and makes funny noises
Listening to Buzz Out Loud to catch @VideoVillain 's call. Caught up with the last dozen BoL shows over my internetless move. Then TWiT time
Lightning and wind. No rain, yet.
@ashedryden no Cryptosporidium in the water according to the City. 
Pictures of the flooding in Iowa: 
Man, I effing hate giant centipedes that come down the wall and attack you.
@cthielen congrats!
New Sigur Ros album is the hotness: 
Now that twhirl seems to be getting through to Twitter again (& observing the API restrictions, natch) I need to start twittering more. Yes.
@jdavid AMD's FireStream 9250: 
mmm. giant bowl of oatmeal, swamped with cold milk, and a small mound of brown sugar and cinnamon. perfection.
Still 1000+ unread in GReader. If only I could pause the incoming posts for awhile to sort through stuff. Sleep sounds better than this.
Dear GReader Team: Please implement a filter for annoying "today's tweets" posts in my friends' blogs. I see them 20 other places already.

@KeVroN re:wisco needs funding! What about Getting Real? Startups don't need millions in VC anymore. 
new userpic, improvising without Photoshop. view fullsize for detail. (GraphicConverter's unskew tool is a decent way to fake perspective.)
Testing from teh TwitterLocal AIR app. Doesn't seem to grab tweets under new client restrictions.
Like a song on Pownce but there's no download link? (due to new share-to-all feature) Just view source, search for mp3 and grab entire URL.
Anyone headed to #barcampmadison2 from Milwaukee that has room in their car? I'd like to go & can help with gas.
Good night, moon: 
Dm cheshter just lost power, sitting in the dark
Coffee, bikes speeding by, the crack of a starter pistol, and laptops. That's right, coworking in Stone Creek on N.Oakland. 7:30PM. Be there
Just saw a cyclist in full race gear pulling a beer cooler & swilling a beer, ride past a cop in the middle of the street, at speed. Ah, ...
Putting together ideas for sessions at BarCampMadison2. If anyone has done livecoding and/or mixed live music in the past, plz get in touch.
@VideoVillain Just realized that it is 4AM. Will try to make it to cow orking in any case.
Hello sunrise.
@raster also, I took your recommendation from a couple weeks back and grabbed iDrum. I dig it.
Reviewing noisemaking apps for code raving/possible livecoding+music at BarCampMadison2: Spongefork is awesome! 
@elizagauger As long as it's not Bat Smax boxers/thongs, I'm game.
Ira Glass says you start out unable to fulfill your own ambitions; it might take 8 years. This doesn't help me feel any better right now.
A horde of baby house centipedes just swarmed out of what must be a vast underworld behind my walls.
Holy cow, the Startup Schwag shirts this month are awesome. That's right, plural, -shirts-. I thought I cancelled Startup Schwag sub though.
@blissdev scp? rsync?
Testing from update twhirl. Does it crosspost to identi.ca too?
Potential BarCamp zero-preparation session: How to Lose Your Sanity Through Automating Your Life with IRC Bots.
My foot was just dive bombed by some large beetle (which luckily, it seems, cannot bite or otherwise sting). The fscker interrupted my tea.
@VideoVillain Fridays are talk-like-a-pirate-on-twitter days.
@marcusnelson congrats!
@Oshuma I'll take your word for it, added! :) Now to just finish turing my notes into a presentation..
@Oshuma Do you think that's the definitive beginner book for Ruby? I learned from the PragBookshelf Ruby book, but I wasn't a n00b. Apress?
Just discovered that there is such a thing as Jolt energy shots. 4 in a box for $5. Buying some for barcamp madison2 :D
BarCamp Madison2 folks: I'm working on my presentation and would like feedback on whether it is too basic: 
Arr, CNN.com, when I be puttin a search query into yer site, I want news not your landlubberin' rebranded Google search. Now walk the plank!
Arrr, mateys. Midnight. It be another landlubber-free-Friday on the Twitter-seas.
Just played with an OLPC XO for about 5 mins. DO WANT
Thx guys got the dns. Now to fix the WAPs
Can someone txt me the opendns server IPs? The wifi here is misconfigured & doesnt assign dns
at Barcamp Madison2. Very cozy.
We hacked the detour, and we have a rough general idea of where we are
@blissdev no problem. Just realized I didn't have your cell #. Gives me more time to think about what /not/ to bring..
All equipment locked and loaded for the rendezvous tomorrow. I mean, all packed for BarCamp Madison2!
9PM the night before a barcamp and already I'm shouting "HOW IS BABBY CODED. HOW COMPUTER GET PRAGNET."
nooo they be stealin mai internets! 
Dismantle the moon! Dismantle Mars! Build masses of nanocomputing nodes, each running off the waste heat of the next. Matrioshka brains!
BarCamp Madison2 photos that I've uploaded so far: 
Hmm. So I can get roughly 1/2 the photos online. Batch upload now and wait until the 1st rolls over for the rest? Also, tagging fatigue.
117 photos to process and upload. Dunno if I have enough space left on flickr to do so.
Arrived at brookfield, soon to be home in shorewood and then sleep. For a long time.
Photowalk around the Wis Capitol in 5. Let's hope we don't get harassed by the po-po.
@NikolHasler There's kids on Twitter. Don't you mean, "all up inside the va-jayjay."?
4AM & the pizza's still good.
Coding at Barcamp Madison 2.
Barcamp madison2 folks: i have been informed that dark knight is showing on the imax at 1:40am
New blog post: Madison Street Art 
Sorry to say it, but IRC had news of the quake before Twitter. YMMV, however.
I am a huge Creative Commons-licensed nerd! 
define 'grok' 
@Oshuma Oh man, this shirt is all kinds of awesome 
Folks, I have food again. Starvation can be avoided for at least another 2 weeks. Hurrah.
Genius. 
Crazy bugs be attacking me. Calling for backup. Napalm the whole thing, it's the only way.
Ghostbusters, on Hulu.com, for free? Alert the internets!
@svdodge Any idea which place is open the latest?
Haven't eaten. Thinking of getting pizza and then spending the night at a nice air-conditioned coffee shop until closing. Anyone interested?
@svdodge 
@svdodge piezo buzzer/speakers (the greeting card or even alarm clock kind) work good as an acoustic pickup, properly mounted.
the delicious redesign is beautiful; last.fm's still sucks; all you haters need to step off
@PaulGrahamRaven Heh, yeah. I already see people moving over to Identi.ca and doing new stuff on the iPhone; will need to jump aboard those.
@PaulGrahamRaven a Mathias Gould would have known an Isambard in the Wastes, at one time. Nice to see you on twitter :)
@PaulGrahamRaven Oh snap. Isambard Portsmouth? going out on a limb here..
@Oshuma Totally srs. Cheese is an American-made product, made from dairy, which is made from cows, which eat corn. Noticed price++ last year
boredom, defined 
Watching @hotdogsladies and @fakemerlinmann go at it on the same page is making my day.
After a few days, this BarCamp Madison2 recap blog post is so stale and late that I don't think I'll bother posting it.
surreal. i haz one.
@Oshuma The cheeze is a good indicator of economy stability, I've found.
@hotdogsladies The Wikipedia article for merkins didn't mention anything about YLNT, so I just "fixed the glitch," if you catch my drift.
So help me Roomba, if you come rolling out of the closet again towing a coat hanger, flip flop, & a sock.. don't give me that innocent look!
@ashedryden have a good time at batman :D
@trodrigues Issue for me is full control over config, but don't want learn a new config format or scripting lang. No Lisp/Haskell/Lua either
@trodrigues xmonad is neat. also, dwm. I actually like wmii the best, though.
Hurr hurr "with an attitude like that you'll never get a job!" not in Wisconsin I won't! Back to business as usual, the web is a fad anyways
@Oshuma Waiting for Wisconsin to impress me with a job ad that doesn't list COBOL or AS/400 as a req for a coding job ;)
Need a job so I can afford to go to C4[2]. Do want. Would be such a cool birthday present to go, too.
@blissdev I hope your laptop problems get fixed soon. That really sucks.
It's hot everywhere. I give up.
Don't all these people sitting in the only outlet spots in Stone Creek know I need power? Why are they here? Don't they have AC at home? Bah
MY SHIRT IS PLURK. YOU ARE OVERWHELMED BY MY SOCIAL MEDIA.
To the pharmacy for a box of Amp'd or Rockstar, and then to the coffee shop for beans and a mexican spice latte. Got caffeine?
@Oshuma re:coffee. Of course I drank it. It was terrible, and it is not fueling the number of words needed to finish this blog post. Avast!
This coffee is terrible.
@raster hay d00d why so quiet wink wink nudge nudge.
I can't help it. The headline was "Microsoft's plans for post-Windows OS revealed" and my mind parsed it as "Microsoft plans worst OS ever"
@fiddlemath It's still on Hulu!
Microsoft Mojave Experiment: Because Lying to People is Totally Viral Marketing.
Jolt Enduro Shot is really accelerating the caffeine high I've been riding since we were at Alterra. Will be 'hello sunrise' for me, I bet.
PyUnit is CruiseControl for Cool in Python.
my coffee. it haz a flavor. chunky!
I love blogs: Of course someone has thought up & done a post about using PyUnit with Google Appengine & Django and done the thinking for me.
@blissdev uhh. happy reverse day!
At humbolt alterra, getting food. Bring powerstrips.
@bartka thanks for the suggestion. Will check it out.
Not on the twitterlocal board. I count at least 15 tweets in the last 24 hrs. Make that 16. Disappointed in you all, you're grounded.
I need a good nautical bar here in MKE. Had one in Racine that I was on good terms with, despite the pirate outfits. (That I wore.)
At the park, watching the lake. Refreshed.
retweeting from earlier: I still want to do Diggnation tonight. I just don't have the space here (or a TV) but I haz beer. Anyone game?
Wow, way too much Air playing on that Pandora station (not that I /don't/ like Air).. fixing.
background music to a day of dev: 
Right. More coffee then? Splendid.
Ok, so I still want to do Diggnation night. I just don't have the space here (or a nice TV ot put it on) but I can provide beer. Anyone?
survived. accidentally got run over by a blind person. I really didn't know how to explain the fact that I was contact lense-less to them.
going out into the world without contact lenses. wish me luck.
@svdodge now you can play it!  Mac-only, of course.
Second Life acct had profits sitting in it from a project long-ago. Used the money to buy some domains.
Oregon Trail in the great OSXII emulator. This is such a great game and part of my idea-generating process. Yes.
Status: coffeenating.
Are those shadows under your eyes or are you just insomnia to see me?
Anyone want to do the Diggnation + beers tomorrow night? Not really up for it tonight, but planning now would be good..
Gah. Just woke up from an all-afternoon nap. Must've been the heat.
Giant centipede still on teh loose. Dunno if I can sleep with it not dead.
My camera is unable to capture the epic giant-ness of this centipede in my apartment. At least 5 inches in length.
Too smokey; too loud
At britinn discussing wired. Oh wtf they be doing the karoake
heading down to the Britinn on N. Oakland in a few. We may be forced to huddle around @VideoVillain 's iPhone to get our Diggnation fix.
Just signed up for Twitxr only to realize that you need a phone that does email to use it. Which services do MMS -&gt; twitter?
@raster drywall where?
Wondering if @factoryjoe 's tweet was meant to draw in @kevinrose. In any case, it may help Kevin find a freelance iPhone developer.
@jbdryden congrats
@raster oh,btw, I'm unfollowing people who talk about Sports. Even those that say "hate favre". goodbye :P
And of course it's too warm, and they're drinking tea on Diggnation instead of beer. Blah. @mathiasx fail.
Diggnation party in Shorewood in a few minutes. DM for info. Going to order pizza.
HAI GUISE. SIM CITY? 
OH: "Please don't go 180 mph on your scooter."
wifi antenna "is made of sturdy fiberglass construction and, if mounted on a mast properly can withstand extreme wind speeds over 130 MPH."
I could be at home listening to Radiohead. Instead I'm at a coffee shop listening to Radiohead. It's very indie, I'm told.
@VideoVillain DMCA takedown notice in 3... 2... 1...
I usually don't show up to Alterra too early because I don't think anyone gets any work done when I'm here.
they're thinking up terrible marketing for my new site.
Heading out to Alterra on Humbolt. Late as usual.
Diggnation party here tomorrow. Working on the time. DM for address. You don't have to bring anything, but redbull or beer would be nice!

i have slain the beast. all is right in mattopia.
It was like a perfect pattern, laid out in front of me. And I realised we're all part of it, and all trapped by it.
I felt like I could see everything that happened, and everything that is going to happen.
It's like I could see the whole thing, one long chain of events that stretched all the way back.
I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
Oh, nothing to worry about. The transfer application dates have all long since passed; there's no way to get into UWM anyways. I give up.
UWM has lost my physical application in the past. Now I try to apply online &find out system will be 'upgraded' on the 13th, losing all data
All the talk about Top Gear yesterday has me watching the challenge episodes again on the Youtubes. Again.
Nvm, sleep sounds more fun.
Whoever is smoking outside my window better start running now. You just triggered my super-angry-smash allergies.
@blissdev @Oshuma Sequel, + musical commentary track in the works for DVD, plus a contest to design your own villain for evil league of evil
Doctor Horrible. Again.
Cooled off here, very nice. Everyone went their separate ways, though, so now I catch up on my podcasts.
$512 for C4[2] in Chicago versus $40 for StartupWeekend Madison. I know where I'm going in September. (Hint: It's Madison!)
I keep hearing that we're entering the post-web2.0 era. Great. Because what webapp dev really needs is a postmodernist slant.
Need someone to make a Fail Whale oven mit. I can't sew. kthxbai.
Anyone from Milwaukee or Madison headed down to SocialDevCamp? (Have another seat in your car?) Yeah, I realize it is tomorrow.
Feedburner gets a lot of love from the chicago barcamp crowd
HFCS from energy drink is really crashing my system. Most of it spilled on my bag though when the can destabilized on the molecular level.
A session on Actually Useful Trust Metrics. w00t
Dm narkalent any chance you're around tonight? This event is literally in the mccormick tribune center L station(i think its called that)
Taking notes in quadrule moleskine rather than trying to boot laptop at each session. No internet distraction & probably capturing more data
At socialdevcamp in chicago, waking up with some coffee in the first session
Rolling to chicago with @kevron . Yeah, it doesn't start for another 7hrs, but this way we get to sleep
@compujeramey I like public transit as much as the next person, but I wouldn't get toChicago early enough, but a car can park on UIC campus.
The bright sun won't let me sleep just yet. Feel like I'm above the Arctic Circle. Going to watch Diggnation, I guess.
Chocolate Silk-brand soy milk makes everything better.
Realized I had the smell of a crazy homeless person too. Ugh. Hour shower power.
Wow, I look like a crazy homeless person. Also, home.
At a place with 1337 in the window. Photos ensue
The sun is awesome. Wait, what? Gmail is down? Cool.
@compujeramey Yeah, I know. & MIS folks typically are from other areas than CS. I'm just saying that MIS &gt; CSci in terms of amt of sc ...
@compujeramey Anyone could pass CS tests. And sorry, but a real CSci degree is about as related to industry as astrophysics to building cars
Starting to see an MIS listed as a prereq for certain IT support/admin jobs. This diploma/certificate arms race has to stop somewhere.
Does Starbucks' wifi stay on after they close? Just curious.
Starbucks doubleshots seem to be either completely nasty in flavor or tasty. Never in the middle.
Get these mf'ing centipedes off my mf'ing plane! Carpet bombing whole regions to ensure pwnage. I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.
Only one photo from this weekend came out (point&shoot + weak flash = grainy, shaky pics) 
"You are human, you must not worry cereal company repossess your small intestine because digest unlicensed food with it, right?" Accelerando
Used books ordered via Amazon still aren't here over a week later. Of course all the sellers used USPS without a tracking#. So frustrating.
Lunch with the @Kevron, sharing our impressions of SocialDevCamp Chicago.
Not mentioned in last tweet: about 500 programming books and iWork '08 were also recommended by THE ALGORITHM.
According to my recommendations, Amazon wants me to buy a Canon SLR camera, read more Neal Stephenson and Vernor Vinge, and buy Puma shoes.
Mister Owl, How many cups of coffee does it take to get mathiasx up in the morning? "One, two, three..." *crunch* Answer: espresso beans.
@ryangraves If you're at the #web414 meeting on Thurs night, I'd like to hang out and help out, if I can. There's other WP/CSS gurus as well
I made it through the mixwit of terrible music that was on Coding Horror, but some of those songs were so painful. 
@SimplyPanera irc.prison.net works pretty well for all my needs, if you're still wondering which IRC server to connect to.
Another night, another dinner I forgot to make; PB&J it is then.
Got a copy of Sycamore Smith & The Pendulum from someone; so happy. Sycamore Smith's band The Muldoons was a big part of my life in Michigan
@ckittel re:read to understand, totally. So many books I've read 2-3 times, so many that I should reread again.
Girl at coffeeshop: thats a lot of books. Me: uh thanks, I guess 3 is a lot?
They were playing the Serial Experiments Lain song by Boa in the grocery store earlier today. It was weird.
Realized I have 2 programming books open as PDFs, one as a website, numerous programming blog posts, and like 10 dead tree books. All unread
I just lost the game. Guess you did, too? Huh.
Shoes (_why's cross-platform GUI library) now has threaded background download. Very slick, becoming very AIR-like 
Sites with a "Keywords: " line on them: lame.
@ashedryden yeah. No pirate logo on the shirt? Yarr!
Latest Venture Bros is go. Now sleep.
My new domain doesn't show up anywhere on google's radar yet. Ouch, will have to work on that.
Yeah, #web414 folks: OpenID login on barcampmilwaukee.org doesn't work. Please fix soonish. kthx!
AOL acquired Socialthing? phooey. I liked that one, the few times that I used it.
Hanging out at Bworks while some other meeting goes on after web414. Reading the books I twittered about so much today.
At web414, chillaxing. Flex + AIR preso up first.
Re: last tweet, to further explain: Video that emulates the stuttering brokenness of flash players = obviously a great idea.
To be honest, I can't be bothered to watch these Adaptive Path Aurora videos. They're annoying & long where text and screen shots work best.
Okay, iTunes keeps crashing. This is NOT COOL AT ALL. Fix it, Apple!
Goodbye scraggly beard. You will be missed.
Need more caffeine. Having it airlifted in.
Remembering the appeal that Stevie Ray Vaughan held for me in the past.
Missed my 2800th tweet. Oh well. Here's to hitting 3K in the next few.. days.
Had a great time with @ashedryden, @blissdev and @VideoVillain tonight at dinner. Worn out now from the day.
Tweaked my back carrying heavy load in messenger bag with unpadded strap. Great.
Refueling with a can of Amp sugarfree at the halfway point
Y strap on the timbuk2 bag helps even when walking witih a heavy load. Just looks silly

Hard to tell whether a day has been productive or not; so much of what I do is intangible. Will call it a night, in any case.
@svdodge At first it could be a way to group buy-in for bandwidth (and for the facility), then later profits from hosting go into upgrades.
@svdodge Thinking it'd be a way to reuse old gross buildings in the city. Would need green power and massive AC upgrades, then volunteers.
Just misread the phrase "commodity datacenter" as "community datacenter" and was thinking how awesome a community datacenter co-op would be.
@cthielen Pandora will soon be out of business if the royalty tax continues.
crackly sound from desktop speakers, constantly. Not a good sign. Will go hunt some new cables to replace things.

Watching Ruby Hoedown 2008 videos on confreaks.com while making dinner.
Addicted to the Rockstar Juice varieties.
@compujeramey No, but stealing my identity becomes so much easier when social networks are dying to give my information away. SSN is next.
Protip: don't cross the streams!
Just paid for a seat at StartupWeekend Madison. Now to find a ride :D #
imeem has been showing my full birth date, without saying it would, because of a required sign-up form field. Many other sites do this, too.
TED Talks are addictive. I think I've said that before.
Yes, Mr. Plymouth Neon-with-a-turbo driver, doing a burnout in the parking lot of a video rental store makes you a total badass.
@Oshuma Sometimes, when I flick on the light fast enough, the edges of the walls and floor seem to move quickly. Luckily they're not roaches
@cheshster's Windex-method of killing centipedes is once again employed. They are making their last stand, but fortifications are holding.
Got this book when I was 13-14, reread it today (skipping the activities that take a long time). Inspired again. 
OH: "she actually fishes out any furry bits, and uses what's left"
Upholstered furniture has all been cleaned; roughly 1L of nicotine removed in total. Remind me not to pick the chairs from smoker's houses.
black tea, loose + new book, bought used + big chair = contentment.

By means of caffeine, I have succeeded in conquering yet another boring technical book. huzzah!
And fresh coffee. I have to give Milwaukee that.

Wagon broke an axle, we'll be delayed here for 3 days. Plz send supplies: 2x pallets of Rockstar Juiced, an espresso machine, and a macmini.
@gilesgoatboy danke. I am stupid.
@gilesgoatboy URL? googling for any variation of "things to do list" comes up with lists of things-to-do, apparently.
No, I'm not going to take sides in this little squabble between you, the pool boy & the dog walker. Who are you & why are you in my house?!
Lazy Sunday.
This just in: 
Every night in my apt, I play a game of this 
@compujeramey Pittsburgh is neat. Surrounding downtown on all sides is old bridges and hills. Haven't been there in about 6 years though.
The entropy (read: brokenness) of my technology is proceeding at a rather alarming rate.
Implemented an entire webapp today just on the Heroku (hosted Rails, with an IDE thing). Fairly impressed.
@Timfastic DO IT.
A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
@web608 canhaz highspeed bullet train to Madison plox?
@ashedryden That's really sucks! Sorry to hear that :/
Ratatat's LP3 is really good. I mean really, really good.
finished all of the Ruby Hoedown 08 videos. Chris Wanstrath's keynote is particularly great. I need to start going to Ruby confs.
@littletinyfish Never found the "Teach Yourself X in Y Days" books to be very helpful. The trick with Perl is learning 30 ways to do things.

@blissdev All my Ruby and/or Rails books are too old, they all talk about Test::Unit. Blech. Sorry.
Searching Amazon with Ubiquity by simply highlighting book title and invoking ubiq 'a'= so awesome
Not having audio on this computer was at first frustrating. Now it's really enjoyable. Also, it tells me "STOP TRYING TO WATCH YOUTUBE."
Can't make outgoing calls from my phone. This is neither preferred nor acceptable.
Everyone's talking about Palin being another Harriet Miers? I thought they meant Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister. *badgeflash*
This coffee needs a little dash of poppy seeds and cold hard cash. Now brace yourself, here comes the crash. The bus just hit an icy patch.
@joshjs Nah I'm up Oakland, but still.
@joshjs Oh dude. You live across the street from me.
@Oshuma @blissdev pair-programming night sometime? pizza, projector, laptops?
Oh my. Ubiquity failed there, somehow, by inserting the thinking machine's pastebox into my twittergram. Terrifying. 100% Egyptian Cotton.

The V8 Javascript engine running Google Chrome is intriguing in itself. Will have to investigate further.

@Tmtx welcome to twitter!
Remembering Windows XP and all the torture it brings. Need to boot back into OSX soon.
Bootcamp partition is out of space. Might have something to do with the 8 browsers now installed that weren't there 30 minutes ago.
@ashedryden ohnoes. I /will/ beat you to 3K updates! Somehow!
In other news, Google Chrome is really slick. Are they a true open source project, in the sense that I could contribute code to it?
Oh, phooey. M$ made me install IE7, and Motorola's installer specifically seems to want ¨IE 5.5 or higher¨ B0rked, no firmware upgrade today
Trying out Google Chrome in bootcamp while I wait for (old) cellphone to flash a generic firmware. Oh & Motor firmware flashing req'd IE6 :P
Used hardcover copy of Accelerando is here; spent previous life on a shelf in the Montgomery Public Library. Which Montgomery? Who knows?
If anyone is upgrading from a fatty nano to a new iPod, let me know. I might be interested in buying the fatty.
Holding off on the iTunes upgrade for at least a few more days; need more in-depth reviews & opinions on it.

OH: I'm Tropic Thunder behind.

I'm becoming rather fond of Adagio Spring Darjeeling as a light afternoon wake up.

At night, I think the view out of my blinds is the cityscape from Deckard's apt in Blade Runner. In reality, it is the Hollywood Video sign.
@blissdev Yeah, don't forget me :)
I guess I'll have to check Identica for Z2 party updates, since it is Friday.
Mogwai plays for my ears only, making legs march in the all-too-familiar rhythm of the carless. Back to the Lake, my oldest constant friend.
@rohdesign I like it a lot. Very clever, sir. :D
@joshjs Uncle Tupelo ftw. Which albums do you have?
@blissdev Haml, for variety?
@compujeramey Just did a double-take on the Fresh Coast Ventures logo. Why is the Sears Tower next to the MKE Art Museum?!
Twitpic is lame. They only give me an email address to send images from my phone to. Well, my phone doesn't do email. No txt? srsly?
Everything feels damp and cold and stuffy. And I'm inside.
I've replaced myself with a small shell script. Now what to do?
"Hey did anyone notice that Obama's site is xhtml 1.0 and McCain's is HTML 4.0 strict?"  from Sept Web414 meeting.
At Alterra at Humbolt. Only one outside (under the roof;inside is packed). Hoping it doesn't start raining hard. Reading.Anyone else coming?
Bike path along the river at capitol is a big muddy puddle. Briefly entertained the idea of @narkalant 's idea of warRafting down to locust
At Stone Creek on N Oakland for at least the next 4 hours.
Tea time -&gt; 
I really would like to try Changes.app but it is Leopard-only. Sigh. Snow Leopard can't come soon enough.
I think the true purpose of Girl Talk's music may be to listen to bits of songs you'd be ashamed to have show up in your last.fm scrobbles.
@ashedryden They'll be anodized pink and Macbook Air-thin, but with superdrives inside. Also, quadcore Atom procs, 8 gigs RAM & Snow Leopard
Have Anathem. Must read it before the Stephenson reading on the 22nd. See you all on the 23rd..
@cheshster We have online ordering for a local pizzaplace. We ended up calling in the order last time we tried tho.Niche market for webapps?
The assumption that microformats handcoded into a site & viewed with Operator are the intended purpose is way off. Think mashups+semanticweb
I'd like to see a CS101 course that uses Ruby, first as scripting (data types, loops), then procedural lang, then OOP, then llambda & Lispy
Also, music from Anathem at:  Think Gregorian chant structured to represent numbers/theorems.
Oh look, Cryptonomicon is free to read online: 
The new M$ ads provoke; lines of battle drawn so clearly. No doubt, soon a horde chants "I'm a PC" at the Helmsdeep-like walls of Cupertino.
New Twitter design is acceptable. Surprised not to be seeing more tweets about it. I've changed my design; the old Oregon driveway is gone.
HOWTO read Anathem: Step1: Fashion your own solitary math in a room with a chair & natural light. Stay there. Step2: Drink lots of tea. Lots
Has anyone read Anathem yet? I know a bunch of people that are still reading it, but would like to be able to discuss the whole thing+ending
@ashedryden Have fun in Green Bay :D
Home. Turns out I didn't need more coffee after all; feeling worn out from today. Dinner, sleep soon. Chicago tomorrow for Anathem reading.
Back at alterra, waiting for @ashedryden 's bike to get fixed. MOAR COFFEE
@trodrigues when dark feed days come, hit Mark All as Read. (Your feeds are not your TODO list, your feeds are not worth losing sleep over)
@joshjs I have 'lots' of GReader stuff to read because I neglected it all week to read Anathem. Trimmed down that I only have 128 unread ;)
New userpic. Is it not awesome?
At alterra with @ashedryden, trying to wake up from my Anathem haze.
I think I've seen more of my neighbors in my apt building by sitting out front on a Sunday morning for an hour than in 5 months living here.
A guy driving a Model A just pulled up to the bank next door. wondering if he came to withdraw his savings in silver as well. (lawl history)
"When you come to last page, close book." - Mr. Wu in the Love Bug.
@ashedryden I need to try one of those yet (Stone Creek's?) I've had similar things before, mostly chai with pumpkin flavorish
They changed the venue for the reading so we had to book it across the U of C campus at the last minute
Just walked past Neal STEPHENSON as he got out of his rental car.
@narkalant coming down for the Stephenson reading? my phone doesn't have your # anymore.
Heading down to Chicago by way of UW-Parkside in Kenosha. Later folks.
Attacked by tiny spiders as I prepare for my journey. No doubt the scavengers come to pick the battlefield clean.
Home, after day at Alterra. @svdodge was also there. Discussions of great importance occurred. Started reading Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver
Going to be at alterra on hubolt until at least 5PM. would anyone like to join  me?
@blissdev I don't envy novelists because success means book tours, which is probably really stressful & terrible for them, to do 11 times.
@blissdev he read first 3 pages; there were lots there who hadn't read it yet tho; Q&A was awkward.
Back home from Chicago. Terrible headache since about 1PM today, trying to solve it now with tylenol, herbal tea, and then sleep.
Can't stop drinking this Alterra blend called Cafe Voltaire. Should have known a coffee named after his addiction would be highly addictive.
Second pot of coffee to makeit through teh afternoon.
Fell asleep watching Buffy on Hulu. Tired.
My little brother just complained that his new (short) haircut makes him look like a Romulan. Lawlz all around.
MKE peeps: I'm down by Bay View tonight, is Classic Slice the best pizza down here?
If I hear one more "ohnoes it's the end of teh world!" tweet, I swear. Don't make me turn this economy around and head back to 1999.
Missing (Cornish) Pasties, one of my few regrets of being vegetarian. Also, no one down here can do them justice; would need to go to the UP
After being encouraged to find a new apartment today, we rolled around Riverwest for a bit and declared it too cold.
If your job ad includes a requirement of 5-8 years experience writing code for your in-house consultingware CRM language, you've failed.
@Oshuma Wasn't talking specifically about iPhone. Just don't get why POP/IMAP support isn't enough.
Is M$ Exchange srsly a killer app on phones? Would you not use snail mail if it didn't route through your employer's mailroom?
Really digging this song: 
Centipedes? In my apartment? It's more likely than you think.
@deadlystiletto just left there 20 minutes ago; everything was fine other than a bunch of news copters hovering, waiting in line to land.
Lost in the labyrinth of hallways in this airport hotel, hard-won hot cup of Earl Grey in hand.
Couldn't identify what used to pass as telephone etiquette before cellphones on an old TV show. Listening for dial tone? How I've forgotten.
I like big books and I cannot lie; you other brothers can't deny.
Be careful what you wish for; it's too hot in here now.
Remember those annoying aliens in the coffee room in Men in Black? They found out my radiators were warm and came out of walls. EGADS HUGE.
I keep pushing up the bridge of a nonexistent pair of glasses. Phantom corrective eyewear syndrome.
@cheshster I prefer to think about the particle configuration in which I'm a famous rockstar whose finger can't be dislocated playing guitar
@cheshster I don't subscribe to Stephenson's Narratives kthxbai.
I'd forgotten how easily my finger dislocates when playing guitar; an unpleasant surprise followed by having to ice it down. Gah.
Man, I had heard this global warming thing was going to make winter worse. I didn't realize it was bad enough to make it snow on Mars though
Wishing I was in Chicago (Sorry guys). Going to make some hot tea and then go back to sleep, hoping this cold will go away.
#BCMKE3 Can anyone get ahold of an office-sized coffeemaker for the weekend? Church-percolator would even work, I guess. I've got teh beans.
@fiddlemath Would like to hear your thoughts on Anathem some time. Going to make it to BarCamp Milwaukee3 by any chance?
@joshjs Want a ride to the Barcamp preparty tonight?
I have a fever, and the only cure is more Girl Talk. (And cowbell.)
BTW, party at BarCampMKE3 when I hit 3K tweets.
New session idea for #BarCampMKE3 -&gt; Come learn Clojure with Me (A Lisp-like language on the JVM that I don't know yet) Anyone interested?
come play BarCamp Milwaukee3 Blockles: 
Going to play a game of Blockles... 
First barcamp mke3 topic: goldfish memory.  Oh look, a castle! Oh look, a castle!
First night in my apartment building that it's loud from a party, I have a cold, and it is the night before BarCamp. I can't win. Need sleep
I won. 
At home. Watching Diggnation with @ashedryden. Pizzas later.
I HIT 3K TWEETS PARTY TIEMZ PARTY TIEMZ
People are leaving #BCMKE3. Wish we could party like this for a week. With sleep, of course.
Bailed on BarCamp in favor of my own bed. Still trying to beat this cold. Sorry guys :/
Where's Krueger?
Interactive fiction with teh Boone
Anyone have success using a crock pot as a rice cooker? I know it won't be automatic, that is, it won't shut off when the rice is done. kthx
Can't... wake... up... zZzzzzz
Thinking about how much of my trash is compost-able. Wishing I didn't live in an apartment so that I could actually implement compost bin.
Had a great time tonight with @ashedryden, @VideoVillain and @deadlystiletto. Awesome end to an awesome  weekend. Huzzah.
finally found a use for mixin; not generally a fan of yet-another-social-network, esp when it feels like they could all be riding on twitter
err, #web414 'bot' even.
Dunno whether to be scared or not that @web414bot doesn't know who I am.
RAIN RAIN GO AWAY
CHARGIN MAH LASERS (ipod + cellphone + camera rather)
@raster That is, just 'git init' initially, 'git add' your stuff, and 'git status' to see what's changed. Occasionally 'git commit'. Simple.
@raster I can't force you to like git. But I can show you some cool stuff. Also, it's an understated tool, just use it.
Fall colors and beautiful weather today.
Way too nice outside not to be enjoying it right now.
@KeVroN 
Pioneering the art of black tea lattes with pumpkin spice and cinnamon for fall. Okay, so plenty of people have made these before. Tasty tho
@KeVroN Beautiful analog reverb tanks. All shimmery. Mmm, tasty.
@KeVroN Funny, I was into Last of the Shadow Puppets before Fleet Foxes. Didn't see a link between them before. Both good stuff.
@littletinyfish I really enjoy Radio Lab, too. Also love the shorter podcasts over the summer, they're easier to get all the way through.
Hunting for an apartment in which all the walls are whiteboards.
My DSL just went dead. LAAAAAAME. Sleep now.
thinking I have terrible tirednessitis. No cure, sadly.
mini-review: Stone Creek's seasonal Pumpkin Spice Latte: not nearly enough pumpkin flavor, disappointingly not spicy. Expensive.
Someone tell me what the outcome of this United Lemur stream is tonight at Web414. I srsly am not interesting in hearing his spiel.
Having the weird issue of thinking everything I read is supposed to rhyme. WTF.
I'm writing Javascript as frontend and delivering content via JSON instead of using effing Haml template weaksauce in Sinatra. Love it.
Haven't committed to repo lately. Lots of changes. Hrm.
Did anyone make an iCal/Google calendar for the BarCampMilwaukee3 sessions by any chance? Would really like that .ics file for something.
Haml needs to STFU about 2 space identation before I cap -T it in the Erb with a Rake.
@Tmtx Too old to bother paying to fix it. The issue with alu pbooks, especially 12" model, was warping the lower case. Netbook in my future.
@gilesgoatboy see links in previous tweet. I've switched back to MacVim after spending way too much time relearning keybindings in Textmate
Oh shi-  (watch the video) VIM ftw, VIM with incremental find = totallyawesome. reference: 
My laptop apparently did suffer some damage last night; I've just now noticed that its burning hot while idling and the fan isn't coming on.
Afternoon entertainment: 
Just sat down in one of my old (inherited) chairs and it fell apart. Laptop bounced off the floor but seems okay.
Having one of those nights where I'm completely unsatisfied with my current skill levels and feeling stupid, frustrated.
Anyone from the Midwest (esp. Milwaukee or Chicago) headed to BarCampBoulder3 on the 17th? Just curious.
Does tronathon have a twitter? I'd like to hear more about unconferencr (unconferencer?)
Wow, Hulu is delivering in HD! (not just 480p) 
@svdodge Content different enough that you couldn't combine them all into one personal blog?
@ashedryden I killed a centipede. We both lose our zen karma-points for today I guess.
@nex3 'weaksauce' comment earlier really had to do with Sinatra + Haml templates, couldn't pass data to view. RoR has a means to do this tho
Had another battle with giant mutant house centipede. This one took four direct hits from the sprayer of organic pesticide and kept going D:
@ckittel Corn Syrup/HFCS or other artificial sweeteners? (Aspartame, Sucralose, Splenda, etc)
@raster Is there going to be an internet in 9 years? Will domains still be relevant?
Need coffee immediately. Crash imminent.
Stayed up to catch up on Always Sunny on Hulu. Gah, why did I do this? So tired now.
@ashedryden If you have more than one person at your browser at a time you get to use the intert00bs carpool lane.
@ashedryden We'll put in another lane. It'll be done in 2010.
Problem: as Hulu gets more popular, their site gets more laggy. Especially when I want to watch things in 480p. HEY GUYS DON'T USE HULU KTHX
Looking at apartments tomorrow; have to clean this one up more tonight because they're probably doing an open house and forgot to inform me.
@joshjs Just checked another article, there seems to beconfusion. This one says incoming txts will cost 3 cents: 
@joshjs This is the reason I'll be canceling my Verizon contract when it is up in the spring. Unfortunately other services are no better.
Reason why I may not be replying to your txt: Even with a plan, txts going off the Verizon network (ie to Twitter) will cost 5 cents per. :(
@svdodge BarCampMilwaukee is sort of our all-of-Wisconsin get-together?
@deadlystiletto It starts Nov 1st.
Update: Engadget says nVida says no HybridSLI on the new MBPs. He said, she said.
Not really news on the MBP GPGPU front, but Engadget thinks the new MBPs might be running HybridSLI 
I can only imagine that black-sooted men shoveling coal while some engineer hits large valves with a sledgehammer, Titanic engine-room style
I've come to learn that the banging sounds on the pipes of the radiator in my dining room means that the furnace is being turned on.
Further, will Grand Central/OpenCL be able to use both GPUs in the MBPs? I'm guessing not, given that the 9400M becomes chipset for 9600M GT
Anyone have any more info on Snow Leopard's OpenCL other than the brief paragraph on apple.com? Will photo/video apps be optimized? XCode?
I think this is the first time Apple/SJ has made any mention of 'cores' in GPUs; wondering how much processing OpenCL will put onto the GPU.
Police siren goes by in time to JUSTICE's The Party. I smell remix potential.
"When Buffy and Cordelia attend a frat party, they find themselves being offered up to a reptile-like creature as human sacrifices." Oy.
I have to say, the new Macbooks really look great, even though I'm not a fan of glossy screen. Don't think there's one in my future, though.
OpenCL: I understand ObjC is what coders are coming from;I'm just wondering whether a smart compiler for no-side-effect lang might be better
PDF about OpenCL from Siggraph, not a paper, just presentation slides:  More interesting: 
@MoCheeks Duplicates iTunes functionality = violates TOS
@blissdev while intel would be nice, can't afford it right now. @MoCheeks which is why I want to fix 12" Powrbook & strip it down to netbook
If I get an iPhone, can it pull new podcast episodes over the air from the iTunes Store like it can buy music? Does it play Diggnation well?
Dear Santa: For Christmas, canhaz new laptop battery, new parts to fix Powrbook, RAM, and tools to fix? kthxbai
I'm so steampunk that my apartment is heated by steam. Also, warm radiators are nice to have when it is cold; not so much otherwise.
I want to bring back an old idea:  similar to photowalking.
@heygabe EFNet #ectomo the irc.prison.net server is pretty good as far as EFnet servers go.
@cswingler afaik you have 3 days to get the security deposit back. I'd call them and get an update on status of your lease.
@compujeramey I like it over here on the east side, close to UWM campus. Don't see the advantage of being downtown when bus goes everywhere.
@joshjs Shorewood, just south of Capitol. Nicer building, and my lease was up here.
@Tmtx 
Just signed a lease on a new apartment. Nervous, but new place has brand new everything.
PC LOAD LETTER
@blissdev Have fun. don't get eaten by a deer. or a tree.
@Tmtx Have fun, good sir. Particularly interested in the DIY sustainable green/ecogeek stuff.
Coder interested in neat projects, hot new technologies & writing shipping code seeks fun, challenging job with a Milwaukee zipcode. kthxbai
Back from the Apple Store. @ashedryden got a new MBP! Congrats! Glad to have another switcher in our mac-gang.
twitter is slow tonight, soup.io is down for an upgrade. No one's on IM. Feverish, hungry. Going to stay in & hope to feel better next week.
@svdodge You need to remember the pass phrase then. I trust things like FF3 to store passwords, but have more than one computer that I use.
After worrying I'd forget my new, strong, all-important Google / GMail password, I logged into/out of GMail fifty times or so to make sure.
I've been changing passwords across all my various accounts online, relegating @gilesgoatboy's password rubygem to unimportant accounts.
Wasn't there a Twitter mashup awhile back that tracked the most popular URLs mentioned in tweets? Anyone have a link to something like that?
Balkan Beat Box is good stuff.
@svdodge Definitely; the G4 is really too slow & hot for a laptop, and most stuff is now compiled for Leopard (which I don't have on my PB)
Just found the (relatively cheap) HP MediaVault on Amazon. Anyone have experience with these? Runs Linux, streams iTunes, 500gb+free slot.
@svdodge Sites are selling 12" Alu PBs for relatively cheap (compared to what I paid at the Apple store). I had the same thought wrt future.
@svdodge My plan would be to start off with an empty Drobo and a 1Tb disk. Copy over data from my USB ext hdd, then stick that disk in, too.
@svdodge Agreed. They had a sale awhile back when they phased out the USB-only model. Wish I'd been able to afford it. But firewire isbetter
@svdodge Just saying, Drobo fits the bill as "couple large drives and migrating to a 'finally my storage makes sense' solution." solution.
@svdodge Drobo's the way to go. Unless you want to take it with you everywhere.
This is a weird thing to appreciate, but the tearaway tabs in Safari make my day. They're just that awesome.
Half of the apartment is a boiling hot 82 degrees the other half is a suitable low-70s. Not a fan of the boiler-directly-beneath-apt setup
Speakeasy could give me 6 meg down at my new apartment. Sadly I can't afford it at this time.
@joshjs I don't look at twitter.com all day or run a twitter client. Does following that many people swamp you?
It's possible that Apple is being more honest about their 'typical' response time. Maybe, like battery life, they list average not best case
@MoCheeks For gaming and fullscreen video, yes. You get ghosting effects.
The new LED Cinema display from Apple has a 14 ms response time? 14ms?! I usually won't look at a monitor if it doesn't do better than 5ms!
Listening to the latest Weekly Geek podcast.
Never putting a paper sticker on a laptop or other gadget again. What a pain to clean up. Vinyl stickers, on the other hand, FTW.
@poseurtech The MySQL Admin tools for OSX don't work for what you need to do?
@blissdev another TweetDeck issue I have: No "in reply to x" links for me to follow to see how conversations progressed. Back to twitter.com
@blissdev definitely. I almost wonder if there's a way to force new-tab for everything, not just what Firefox itself opens.
And by useless information, of course I mean how to use IRC. heh
Talking @Timfastic through changing the turn signal relay on his car on IRC. Makes me feel awesome to know otherwise useless information.
Anyone know where I might be able to get a real Japanese-style futon, that I can roll up and hide away at night?
New attack ads from McCain by famous directors; Wes Anderson one is great.  (via @gruber via @coudal)
Ok. TweetDeck is the new hotness. For me at least. Glad I caught @blissdev using it.
Swobo fixies in my size are on sale, $100 off. Must resist...
Found the most random picture ever in my /Pictures folder for an avatar. YES!
@ashedryden Nothing to see here. Move along.
for ($i=0;$i&lt;99999999999999;$i++) { print "PERL"; }
Hai guise what's going on in here?
@poseurtech RT @Oshuma: @poseurtech irssi running in a screen session on a remote machine.  ;P
Yes, I know that there's other ways of getting a wordcount in Textmate (bundles or Filter through command..)
Don't think I'm going to attempt NaNoWriMo in vim. Used Textmate  and 'wc -w novel.txt' in bash as my two tools last year. May do that again
@poseurtech Here's the link 
@poseurtech I got them from MySQL's site. There are tools for monitoring MySQL servers, a schema-explorer, etc. That's all I've used though.
Heading to Alterra.
will have a special treat tonight at Alterra for anyone that uses/likes Digsby.com
@3liza In my old town, an ISP had the city commission a study, knowing the law was in the pipeline. If they did that elsewhere, stuff failed
@3liza There's a law out there, I think it is on the Federal level, that says a city/state can't compete with commercial interest in telecom
Talking with @blissdev about why free urban wifi is such a first world, upper class problem to solve, but why it still would be cool to do.
@svdodge Great. See your scaley hide there. *breathes fire*
@svdodge any chance you can make it to Alterra @ 7PM?
The weather is great; going for a short walk down to the lake to look at the leaves. Later @ 7PM, laptops+devfolks at the Humbolt Alterra.
Dear person upstairs playing Rockband drums: Yes, yes I can hear you. Not that your stereo goes to 11. I hear your feet+sticks.
@marcusnelson: just used UserVoice to vote on that. Very slick.
Sad that 'mutilated' is the word buzzing on Twitter right now. People are like sharks drawn to blood at the slightest hint of this stuff.
@Oshuma It's from Star Trek TOS. The alien is called a Gorn, I believe. (ZOMG I AM SUCH A HUGE NERD)
@Tmtx I haven't gotten keys yet. Pics will be on Flickr as soon as I get in there. Probably more after I unpack and clean up unpacking mess.
@svdodge We need a Greasemonkey script that replaces /all/ Twitter avatars with someone else's, stat.
Already completely out of it, and so much more packing/cleaning to do here before my move.
You'll have to do better than that, Mr. Bond.
@joshjs Yet another blog.
MAKE Issue 1 still holds up, 3 years later. Forgot how much interesting stuff they managed to pack into that initial issue.
Also, looking for hardware hackers in Milwaukee to collaborate on a new project. DM if interested, or grab my email address off my site.
@raster w00t. I want to get Logic Express on my next Mac. Yes, there will be another one in my future. In the far far future.
Just got a rebate check for $99 in the mail. What new gadget should I spend it on? Sadly, it'll probably go towards new apartment's rent.
@blissdev I need to stop telling @blissdev about MBP specs, apparently. ;)
@joshjs I thought so too.
This morning, a couple fights below the window of my apartment building, the girl shouting "I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU" at him.
Too hot in my apartment, & I have to clean because apparently they're showing it (thought they said it was rented?) Goodbye sleep, hello 4AM
Soaking up heat from the radiator like a sponge.
Digging  even though I doubt I would ever buy anything because of it.
Don't know which I find more annoying in TweetDeck, the non-Growl notification window that won't go away when I click it, or the tweet sound
@Im_X1 My tools for finding Twitter users by region aren't very good I guess, I also missed all the people whose profile lists lat/long :)
@jennaddenda I didn't realize there were still MKE folks I wasn't following. Everyone should be all followed up now :D
@mathiasx has a follow cost of 242.42 milliscobles.
@heygabe glad to see you've joined the old-school-movie-monsters club for Twitter-Halloween :&gt;
Wait, how did Twubble know who I am on twitter without me telling it? Reading my cookies?
Writing down 101 ideas for plots for NaNoWriMo as a way to clear my head before sleep. Wish me luck.
Ruby is so powerful, you all have no idea. At least until I write a proper blog post on this.
Was rather productive tonight, must've been Radiohead playing at Alterra for 8hrs straight, but I made some headway in a personal project.
@romke Best to quit while you can ;)
Home from Alterra, still smelling of coffee. Luckily there is no Radiohead playing here.
At alterra for a minute to grab dinner.
Banged my elbow, danced around the room for a few minutes going "ow ow ow"
At Lulu's on Kk in Bayview
Packing for my move. Man, I have way too much stuff for my age.
What kind of company names their digital patient record software EPIC Hyperspace?
@DerKlaus It's basically a reversal of pricing, which I suppose depended a lot on it being cheaper to truck the mass-produced stuff in.
You know the economy is effed up when cheese from a small farm in Wisonsin is cheaper than Roundy's and Kraft. (both from California afaik)
@gilesgoatboy np. Arkx is awesome stuff, it certainly introduced me to new ways of doing stuff in Ruby. Thanks for that :D
@gilesgoatboy Understood. Didn't know how much farther you've taken the crowd drumming idea since Rubyconf and this all looked relevant.
@gilesgoatboy Have you looked into Ruby Arduino to implement hardware stuff?  MIDI Shield 
@littletinyfish I dig Yeasayer, I just don't have the time tonight. Sorry.
Lulu is great food. Back home in Shorewood now. Cleaning old apartment like crazy before I pass out.
OH: He's moving to shorewood & I don't want him (her boyfriend) to turn into a Sally.
Went with Amazon's mp3 store because it only took one click, cost the same across the board, & got DRM-free decent-quality VBR mp3s.
yarr 8-# ////Ö\\\\ &gt;o&lt; 
Anyone know which online music store gives artists the best cut? iTunes, Amazon, amie street, other?
Need to build a landing strip / all-gadget charging station for my new entryway. Finally have the space for it.
Sorry twitter. No more internet until the local phone company says so, and I have to pack up old apt here and leave it clean tomorrow.
The reason being that two antennas on perpendicular planes cannot see eachother; the slight deviations from that angle still allow a signal.
You can home in on wifi APs the same way they found uboats in WWII: 2 antennas perpendicular to the AP's plane, weakest signal = aimed at it
Found a key on oakland. Anyone missing a house key?
Phone co never came; insist that my install date has been for the 6th. The 6th?! I think I'll cancel things before that. Covad-- Speakeasy--
These old apartments are hard to wire up without lots of extension cords. 1 outlet per room (always on the wrong side) & 1 phone jack in apt
SuperDuper!ing my powerbook before Leopard install. Still no internet here.
Nanowrimo isn't going so well. Distracted by unpacking, still no internet here. Nothing I try to write seems to stick. Progress: 1300 words.
@VideoVillain w00t. looks good.
Wrote a Ruby one-liner using rest_client to delete tweet I screwed up, since twitter.com won't let me 
@cheshster to my credit I figured out how to tie a Windsor knot in like 4 minutes once I had the internet, and can do it in the dark now.
Just saw a Dodge neon with fibreglass to make it look like the batmobile. Very weird car. Then the famous milwaukee jesuscar went by.
Ties are too hard without the internet to teach me. Never really had to tie one before...
Jordan: It's also a sign that there's ladies in my room. Me: There are? Because either you've trained them to be very quiet or they're dead.
@littletinyfish Celebrating down at the Art Bar? There's fireworks here and drunk people in teh streets.
OH: "I think the people who have an issue with socialism is like the Red Scare."
Just got frustrated on phone with ISP, Speakeasy, b/c Covad pushed back install to the 12th & I already waited a week. Cancelled everything.
Man. My internets still aren't on. LAME.
Heading home to try new static IP they assigned me. Wishing i had a lineman's headset. Not that i would have one THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL ;)
Firefox is crashing wholesale before it even gets the Profile Manager drawn. Just a blank window. Ouch.
Stopped listening to Miles Davis on my iPod when I realized that they're playing good jazz now in the coffeeshop. woot.
@ckittel but things seem to be moving along again.
@ckittel understood. I'm in the middle of a 2 year contracta & thought my ISP couldn't deliver service because of AT&T not hooking line up.
@ckittel Covad is actually the local phone co, but ISP is Speakeasy. Things seem to be installed now, need to get assigned new static IP.
At the Palomino in bayview pretending I'm a cowboy & blowing off steam.
Lazyweb: need a broadband ISP in Milwaukee that isn't TimeWarner or ATT. All DSL goes through ATT &they've been screwing up install for 2wks
Last call at alterra. At home & internetless again in a few.
OH: "It looks like toast" in regards to a 20 megapixel image of brain tissue zoomed all the way in
At bayshore apple store with @blissdev. He's finally getting his macbook fixed.
On my way to Alterra on Humbolt to catch up on email, then @blissdev & i are headed to the Apple store at bayshore
This morning there was a pre-Cambrian explosion growing on my contact lenses. Who knew my contacts' saline solution was the primordial soup?
At a gigantic mexican restaurant w/ @ashedryden, @blissdev & @videovillain. Falling asleep despite the roar of noisy people
Sitting at a computer w/ itunes all thetime, you forget music is a performance art, going on constantly in bars & clubs, adapting. Strug ...
@ashedryden hot because of all the scarf on scarf action.
@ashedryden THAT SOUNDS HOT
@poseurtech We just decided your full name is Mister 4braham Googlephone Poseurtech.
The better things seem, the worse everything else gets.
At Alterra. Whodathunitk?
A balmy 54 degrees F in my apt at the moment. Just got home from Alterra, still pissed about DSL.
Clarification clarification: I also didn't want to wait another month (& pay for it) while they got their clown circus around to installing.
Clarification: even though I moved & they hadn't started service at my new apt, Speakeasy never turned off service at old apt, so cancel fee
At Alterra again. Freaking out about the amount Speakeasy is charging me for disconnecting even when they couldn't give me service.
On the bus down to bayview. Nice sunny day in MKE today. Just very very cold.
Record time for walking back to apt from Riverwest. Chased two 15 buses but they didnt stop, too cold to stand at bus stops.
Heading home from Riverwest.
Finally the heat in my apt turns on. Building comes alive through burbling, hissing radiators and humming pipes in the walls.
Hyperdub on the bus back home. Wishing for RjDj to mix the sound of rain, the guy rapping to himself, Burial, & bus noises into one groove.
I think this eviction notice disqualifies today from running for 'best day ever,' among other things.
Wanted to tweet about this sweet little model catapult I just built, but then my brain screams "it's technically a trebuchet!"
Distractions ahoy.
City hall project has one of those giant cranes parked in the middle of the street. Dunno when i'll get home.
iPod battery dead. Earbuds alone don't block out enough noise to concentrate. Last.fm don't fail me..
@narkalent also nextdoor to my new apt? Comic book store
@littletinyfish road past my bus on north & oakland.
If anyone wants to do anything tonight, txt or DM. Bored, need to get home out of apt.
Just reassembled the sink drain; maintenance guys never put it together right so it didnt seal up. Doing lots of awesomeness today.
Disregard last tweet. Cut my own hair. Explanation only my UK friends will get: went from being long-hair Beckham to shortshort hair Beckham
No haircut today for me. Hrm.
@svdodge we should totally ask @hypnagogic if we can build catapults+trebuchets at milwaukee devhouse3 & have distance/accuracy competitions
Left earbud on my ipod headphones died. Lame.
Waited over 20mins for the 15 bus. Freezing; it is snowing. WTF
lazyweb: Car wash on the east side?
Awake. They're letting me go home now. Tweeting as requested.
Listening to the guy next door play guitar through the wall. I think he's singing, too.
Hello internet. Finally have DSL at home again.
OH(me): That's it. I'm not fixing any more PCs. You're all getting Macbooks for Christmas. One for Mom and Dad too. I hope you're happy.
Having fun teaching the car wash guy how to operate a pushbutton start toyota hybrid w/ proximity keys. They locked keys inside once already
Sorry that I've been neglecting you, twitter. Maybe we can go out in the yard and play catch, make up for lost time, you know?
Ow ow ow pain.
@compujeramey road still blocked at first financial center by police cordan.
Heading to work, hoping for cleared roads and no GODSeed fragments to battle. Guessing the buses are crowded.
@compujeramey Was Project GODSeed there at the party?
@compujeramey Please set these people straight before we get a bunch of otaku looking for the 'canning district' www.thisismymilwaukee.com
Making fresh ginger tea with lemon. Smells so good. Hoping it busts up this headcold thing I have.
Snag on project while I do geometry. Gah, this has to work with real-world, imperfect data though.
Mmm, clean Javascript.  FTW.
At alterra. Yeah, you could've guessed that if you've been following me for awhile.
Headache. The 60's folk music, it does nothing.
Granted the front wheel's spokes are rusty. The rims are rusty. The frame is rusty. This is beater bike I bought specifically for Milwaukee.
Lucky me. 1st time riding bike since moving earlier this month. Bent spokes on front wheel dropping off a curb (4" max) over on Lake Dr. :/
Dear T-Mobile: Let's make a deal. You bring 3G to Milwaukee and surrounding areas, and I'll buy white G1s for my family, unlimited plans.
@raster Been hanging out on the pbwiki and unfiction forums since this whole thing started. We should talk. Something's up in Sector 21.
This guy won best-dad-ever on Halloween for making a Linux-powered Iron Man suit with his son: 
Going treasure hunting today. I'm buy you a hamBURGer when I get back from the toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooomb!
@Kurt_McAllister Rebreathers are available everywhere and only a few Dark Dollars.
Todo tomorrow: buy more flare guns
OH: It's like croquet only not.
Oregon Trail: "Successfully rafted your wagon down I-94. Welcome to Delafield." Imagine MSPaint drawing of the Kettle Moraine State Forest.
Oregon Trail: "You've reached Waukesha County Airport." Cue MIDI version of Red River Valley.
Oregon trail: "Lost trail. Backtrack 2 days." missed the on ramp for 94 at pewaukee. Going asround for another try.
Treating drive out to delafield via capitol as a game of oregon trail. "you've reached brookfield. Would you like to look around? [Y,N]"
Off to Delafield to covertly cook a vegan Thanksgiving meal for a bunch of meat-eaters I'm related to.
Avoid the cashier's eyes. AVOID THE CASHIER'S EYES.
@littletinyfish Bike polo that bike. Yes.
@theGlenn *cough* DM me to talk about this further.
Pie flipping before we can eat pumpkin pie. Family tradition.
Introductions to dozens of extended family I've never met. repeat answers: "grew up in the UP. live in shorewood now. UWM. Work in bayview."
Seriously twitter, this is all i can do to alleviate the boredom of relatives who are techbophobic & think cellphones are extravagance.
Man, just realized my coat smells like turkey or something. Eew.
@gilesgoatboy Sorry, sarcasm doesn't come across well in twitter. You, ZFSA, Obie, & _why are a few reasons why I keep coding. Fun&gt;dr ...
I have the fake anime themesong from the end of the thisismymilwakee.com video on repeat.
Making coffee strong enough to peel paint. In the Chemex beaker, the most important step is always water temperature.
@heygabe Especially if you're going to upgrade the RAM yourself about 4 months in, invalidating your expensive Applecare plan. I know I did.
Decided that the functionality that lets me CMD-doubleclick a URL in Terminal.app needs to support turning '@username' into twitter URLs.
@VideoVillain  it's highly infuriatingly-stupid and has broken game mechanics.
@rohdesign Oh, totally build over buy for this kind of thing. If for no other reason than to be able to repair anything that goes wrong.
@compujeramey 'hipster' is mainstream consumerism now, under the banners of youth & individuality, with no meaning 
@rohdesign We're young and stupid and our bones will heal if we have a horrible accident. (I broke ribs mtn biking..) So I'm going fixed.
@twordup Not that there's anything wrong with Gnarls Barkley.
@twordup Don't take this the wrong way, but you just accused something of being 'hipster' after tweeting about watching Gnarls Barkley.
@svdodge I'm gonna try to get one soon to replace beater mtn bike. Main reason is more direct feedback from pavement. Also, simplicity.
@gilesgoatboy Gah, I'm going to have to ban you, Zed, & _why from gReader now; I'm breaking my addiction to this valleywagy blogodrama shit.
@svdodge Check this out  I'd do it all in Ruby instead of scripting XSLT.
@KeVroN We could've swapped families. Wait, that sounds weird. Also pretty sure everything I ate today had animal in it (broth, sausage etc)
@svdodge As an avid amazon wishlist user, I support this idea. Wouldn't mind a slicker way to tell it where to put stuff without 3 pageloads
@ashedryden Driscoll family tradition.
Trader Joe's Joe-Joes &gt; Newman-O's &gt; Oreos.
At home. Relaxing.
@ashedryden We take turns flipping our slices of pumkin pie into the air. Idea is to get it to land crust side down. I did well for 1st time
@joshjs Speedtest.net or actual sustained throughput?
@svdodge I have a spare arduino if you want one to fool around with. I can give you some LEDs too for microcontroller "hello world" on it ;)
@cheshster Heh. Twitter is better than blogging if I want to hear others' opinions.
Related thoughts on DIY/hobbies: When is it better to build or buy? If you go by what I just said, almost always buy. But that's not as fun.
So the question becomes, is what you're doing worth doing? Which is what I think everyone should ask themselves. For everything :&gt;
re:10K hrs: I was thinking about how one could easily reach mastery before retiring. But being the best DMV clerk in the world is a waste.
@svdodge "Ten thousand hours is equivalent to roughly three hours a day, or 20 hours a week, of practice over 10 years."
What I ended up using for id3 tag:  If anyone has corrections plz send my way.
Added proper ID3 tags to the mp3 of music from thisismymilwaukee credits, based on end credits. Composer is real, singer's name appears fake
@svdodge Feel free to add your 2¢. I'm curious to hear more opinions on these ideas. Is Photography a good example? $$$ won't make you good.
Picking up lots of followers this week. Hello. Is it something I said? :)
@heygabe Did you compile yourself or did you trust some distro's cry of 'stable versions only!' Screwdrivers from 1820s don't work as well.
@raster Probably. This time around I'm hoping to have firewire audio interface. Last time I was using 1/8" line-in from hacked headphone amp
@raster Open source tools can be good, even better than commercial alternatives. Depends on the field.
This discussion of going with expensive tools over trying to stay cheap is relevant. Thinking staying cheap & getting good is a better goal.
Which means instead of constantly shuffling through projects for 6 months before shelving them for a year, I need to limit & keep working.
So now I know that I've got only a finite number of 10,000 hour blocks I in a lifetime to work with. Unless Ray Kurzweil has his way.
Riffing off ideas in Malcolm Gladwell's new book, Outliers, today. Idea is that he's gone and measured mastery at 10,000 hrs work/study
@raster True. w/ guitar, I remind myself bluesmen like Robert Johnson played on guitars of poor quality, without digital tuners. All skill.
The sad thing is that it's always harder to stay cheap and get good, rather than spend a bunch of money and have no skill to back it up.
No matter the hobby, there's always a way to do it cheap, & a way to put yourself into debt with boutique bits. Guitars, bikes, cars, etc.
@Oshuma DEN I CANHAZ CHEEZBURGER.
@Oshuma That's brilliant. OH HAI: BRING LULZ AS A CODER, ADD LOLCATS. MISHUN: CODE GIVN THERE IS NO LULZ. WEN INVISIBL BIKE AN "HAZ BUKKIT"

@svdodge @joshjs wow you guys read into what I do too much. It was LEDs on a jacket.
Word mixup: Flashet jacking.
Packed into the booth by the window at Alterra, super comfy.
OH: Hire a cop.
Discussing Oregon Trail tactics.
Just got a shoulder-glare from some lady for listening to the thisismymilwaukee themesong in Alterra. Screw you, lady, I'm proud of my city!
Me: Here, go get me a latte. *hands over cash* No no, I need to get change for this *take money back* Here, go buy yourself something pretty
OH: "You! Come move my rock!"
Heading over to Alterra on Humbolt. You guys know the drill: show up, laptops, code rave. Listening to 8 hours of Radiohead optional.
@astroninja you guys are awesome. 'nuff said.
Realized I haven't bought anything since the 20th. How's that for Buy-Nothing Week? Need to go buy coffee today though. Amazon also tempting

@whil get them some drums and tube amplifiers quick. Kid rock bands are hot right now, see "Naked Bros. Band" on TV. j/k ;)
Entertained the idea of using the tiny can from 6oz of almonds as a wifi cantenna. Know that the wavelength wouldn't like it though.
@svdodge It was a Lilypad Arduino (the sewable surface-mount one) on a hoodie to make bike LED turn signals. We talked about similar ideas.
M83's Before the Dawn Heals Us. Listen to it. DO IT. NOW.
Apologies to @raster for (purposefully?) misspelling his last name.

All the music on my iPod is stale so I might stay and work, where the wifi gives me last.fm, pandora, and songza.
Desk and chair just showed up at the office (for me, apparently). I get the server room. w00t?
Thisismymilwaukee is sending out emails now. Someone find this flickr account they're talking about!
Boss likes IDEs over vim+bash. Textmate really is the only 'IDE' worth using. =&gt; Powerbook is now my main machine at work.
Watching a documentary about bike messengers in Chicago in the 90's. WIN.
Realized I still haven't cleaned up the mess from the day I built a little trebuchet. Gah, apartment is too big, rooms go missing for weeks.
Quiet here tonight. Putting on loud punk music to compensate.

@spellcheque especially when I pay to ride it; silly UWM kids riding free for 1 block are to blame. :P
And i've been waiting 28 minutes for it & there's no bus shelter & the next one wont come for at least 15mins. Fuck you MCTS.
The 15 just blew by me on KK
@cheshster Winter + global warming. Snowed in Moab for the Easter Jeep event there this year, too.
loud. louder. loudest.
 followed by  in an attempt to cheer myself up.
@littletinyfish That's actually really cool. I was hoping for a plow in front, but I guess it would need torque coming from both wheels
Oh, fail. I never turned on the rice cooker, 45 minutes ago. Starving.
@littletinyfish You should get a plow for your bike. Don't they make those?
@littletinyfish bonus: Wear them around your neck all day and talk about how 'steampunk' your life is. Nevermind they're a WWII design
Bus surfing. Like a big skateboard.
@joshjs say hi if you see me on the 15 bus. Leaving bayview in a few minutes.
Dear radiator: You sound funny.
Anyone else having issues with the latest iTunes crashing on 10.4 and not coming back (Force Quit be damned) until you reboot?
Home.
Determining when to get off the bus purely by dead reckoning & smell. Srsly, the city all looks the same when you can't see.
Should've put my single contact lens back in. Unsure how i'll tell the 11 from the 15
Heading home. Korporate media party later
Not winning the battle against entropy today. Everything seems broken.
Not being able to see disorients my speaking. It's true.
@raster no they're just getting in the spirit. unfortunately.
The facebook-app startup we share the office with is killing the network by downloading huge Christmas music collections. Joy.
@cheshster Only if I wore the eyepatch with the jolly roger on it.
@cheshster I should. I'd be able to see right now!
Gah, what a day to forget to pack my eyepatch. One contact lens just  failed. Half-vision is weird. Also, no glasses. Hrm.
Trying to figure out why Crucial sells 1Gb of RAM for my Pbook for $50+S&H on their site and $30+free shipping on Amazon. Amazon.com ftw.
@svdodge @littletinyfish Economic stimulus of the music industry. I like it. As long as we let the all the labels that make pop music die.
'Slightly dim the  display' in Energy Saver Prefs is not dim enough.

I've got a cold & everything seems to be taking twice as long as it should this morning. Including waiting for bus drivers to switch.
@distancesoft Yo.
My apartment is too hot. Anyone that can figure out a means of bottling it is welcome to take as much heat as they want.
@ashedryden I sure hope you remember me for more than just listening to Journey.
OH: "i put that right back in my mouth" - @blissdev
We're at the advertising museum.
Dm littletinyfish at comet if you want lunch
@blissdev I do. I just have to walk past my door rug like 8 million times a day. And that stuff spreads. Roomba, to the rescue.
Road salt from boots all over my apartment. Stepping on it with bare feet hurts, then stings. Hrm.
Korporate Media Party was a real blast. drive safe, everyone!
At the korporate media party. Woo!
@ashedryden Can I bring my iPod? Can we listen to the MASH SF Soundtrack? :D
@smutandeggs You should still come.
@retrotrash Heh, you're on hipsternascar.com for IRO Sprints in Chicago. 
Guy: "what are you, a pirate?" me, in my korporate media shirt: "YARRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
I'm too busy to click Mark All as Read. Maybe I'll send it off as a Mechanical Turk task on a monthly basis.
@blissdev Is it Kelly Clarkson?
First pot of coffee for the day, singing along to The Mamas and The Papas
Good morning world.
@distancesoft That's not a half-bad idea. It'd keep both the munchkins & over-dramatic roleplayers constrained to 140 chars or less per turn
@jbdryden @ashedryden Thanks for hanging out today :D
Apparently I am fail at DMing from my phone.
@sarahreese Yeah, except I was trying to sleep now, and they're still be loud at 3AM. Heh.
Loud neighbors are loud, and drunk.
Metacortex is deconditioning me.
Related discussion: programming into a framework versus *in* a framework.

PG has sort of become PT Barnum. Sure, you might read something he said and get a pithy quote, but I'm sure most of it promoting the circus.
But Paul Graham probably said all this & more in his Recession essay. Not that I read Paul Graham essays anymore. Too much promotion for Y!C
Or rather (wouldnt fit into 140 chars) now the really good coders that never had to hunt for jobs will be jobless; they should form startups

Debating throwing together an iGoogle theme that looks like the hp mini 1000's UI: 
Wishing I had a nice thick home-made jam to put on this toast.
For one thing, those solutions aren't smart enough to see an issue coming up and alert me before it happens.
Wish I could automate all the tedious things that require attention. Bank, bills,etc can be automated but I don't like the current solutions
Still waiting for a bus, 20 minutes later.
Bus fishtailing in the snow: totally awesome.
I'm really good at borking the entire dev environment, with no error output to guide me towards a solution to boot. w00t.
Office drip-coffee in a cup from the coffeeshop that had a cinnamon-cayenne pepper mocha in it, plus weird chemical-tasting fake creamer. Ew
@smutandeggs Don't like the coffee they sell at the co-op?
Ubiquity 'track' command, just in time for the holiday-Amazon-UPS-tracking season 
Too warm in the @mathiasx estate.
Guessing I need to get more developers as followers if I want to keep asking discussion-prompting questions like that.
Sure testing is great, but what ensures you're writing correct tests in the first place?
My iPod has the new added feature that the 'Hold' button slides over to orange on its own, when I'm not using it. Weird-but-nice failure
@kevinrose oolong
The milk carton just sliced open my finger. Seems like a great start to my day.
We need some more snow, guys. Can someone make that happen for me?
@blissdev Sleepiness is work leaving your body.
Not like I was sleeping anyways. Blah.
Wearing more wool than a sheep to go out for a long walk, and maybe get some coffee. Warm, and big stompy boots to boot.
@retrotrash Good to hear you're doing better.
In other news, I now have a working doorbell and intercom, as well as an additional doorbell in my apt doorframe that I didn't know existed.
Was deep in learning-about-Lisp brainmode when the apt repairman came by. Always enjoy the reaction to the fact that I'm a "computer guy"
At @tapps 's for the concert & the looping/layering  masterclass beforehand :D
@svdodge I can play that song on guitar. Dunno about singing. Might be able to do your ska or metal version in a pinch.
My mom logged into ISP webmail & got upset at all the spam, thought it was from dad looking at 'dirty sites'. GMail never shows her any spam
While there's light out and it isn't snowing, I might as well be outside. Bike ride.
Granted your car would smell like coffee if it stuck to the hot bits like the cat-converter.
Wondering whether used coffee grounds would be a good road abrasive in place of sand (clogs up storm drains) & help prevent over-salting.
@spellcheque The new-edition-every-year thing is another slimy textbook publisher trick, along with 'bundled software is open'.
@spellcheque You could put your old textbooks up on Amazon marketplace or eBay, and probably get more than the bookstore would pay anyway.
Waking up slowly with coffee and Greg Egan's Permutation City (yeah, I grabbed it right after Eliezer posted on it on Overcoming Bias..)
@svdodge Fine then. No QOTD for you. I was only ripping of Bob Dylan saying "I said that" anyways.
Toss-up for best blog name: Guys Who Cut Their Own Hair and If Charlie Parker Was a Gunslinger, There'd Be a Whole Lot of Dead Copycats
(Where 'battery is hosed' means that it is working on charger, but battery isn't holding a charge, it seems. Not good, newish phone.)
Just realized my phone was off in my pocket. Apparently the battery is hosed. Sorry if I didn't back to your txts or missed your calls.
Severe headache from the music in Alterra. Tonight is the loudest in here I've ever experienced.

@joshjs THUNDERSNOW. TWO STORMS ENTER. ONE STORM LEAVES.
@svdodge SnowFest? More like Snowmageddon (credit goes to whoever tweeted this term earlier)
@ashedryden Want help?
Wondering whether wearing my Pownce shirt is like wearing a band's shirt after the break up.
Had a really great time at @tapps livingroomsessions.com Best concert-in-a-livingroom I've ever been to, for sure.
OH: chord progressions are uncopyrightable; harmonies are open-source"
@ashedryden SUPER HERO SUNDAY.
Oh right. These are just wicking sock 'liners'. Thick wool boot socks make such a difference wrt windchill. Back inside to put them on.
This balaclava demands I make ninja noises in the mirror. Ok. Off to Alterra.
(Explanation of last tweet:  )
NO I AM NOT COMMANDEERING THIS BLOOMBERG TERMINAL TO ANALYZE TWITTER FOLLOWER METRICS. I MEAN ERR.
@compujeramey Global twitter-follow confidence bust. Was hoping for a twitter-follower bull market but it isn't meant to be.
@trodrigues I think maybe the shirt is now just a verb for what the ladies should do when they encounter me?
@ashedryden You're not my mom. I'll walk wherever I please.
OCD-like trait of the day: Bidding on eBay with only palindromic numbers. (technically, 'symmetrical' numbers or Scheherazade numbers)
Anyone heading out to Brookfield tonight from the East Side? Need to get to the Bluemound Rd, not looking forward to 1hr+ ride on the 10 bus
Listening to @solobasssteve 's albums at work while I hack out some new-to-me stuff.
Unexpected RuntimeException, you are both my enemy and my debugging friend.
New bluetooth 'notebook' mouse for powerbook (touchpad is mostly dead) is twitchy, tiny. Strangely fits my hand the same as my regular mouse
@manfredmacx sudo make me a pot of coffee.
Hair dried inside my hat = bad hair day = wearing hat to cover it up. I can just claim I'm imitating @distancesoft though.
Gah. I forgot to have lunch.
Last.fm radio thinks I want to listen to Del Shannon and other 50's heartthrobs thanks to the 1000 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die list.
Having to quit twitter because of Packer spam: priceless. Good night Wisconsin.
huh. 
@smutandeggs I love SmartWool.
@gilesgoatboy 
@joshjs Proxy it through Port 80. It's not hard to setup.
@svdodge They have this thing, I think it is called last.fm, that lets me cheat at this game.
This mouse I ordered for my laptop better be the best-thing-ever when it gets here, because Amazon just dropped the price $10 for no reason.
Powerbook is misbehaving today. Hoping it's not getting ready to fail.
Luckily there's no broken glass or I'd be here FOREVER.
Gah, dropped the entire pot of coffee on the floor. Cleanup on aisle 4.
Huge snowflakes are huge.
@distancesoft I like lots of stuff  Not entirely sure what kind of music I'm building this to play, though.
@fragmad Hopefully that wasn't too spammy. :)
@fragmad this may interest you:   (haskell livecoding), see also: 
@fragmad MIDI Patchbay is software, to clarify. 
@fragmad As far as setup, a Mac laptop is ideal :D For live sound, a firewire audio interface, possibly USB-MIDI cable. JACK, MIDI Patchbay.
@fragmad As far as environments, there's Processing, Max/MSP, ChucK, SuperCollider, libs in any language, @gilegoatboy's Arkx, etc.
@fragmad Depends on what you want to do. PracticalRubyProjects book for Ruby MIDI, OSC tinyurl.com/54ogxb These control most gear|software
@svdodge Thanks.
@svdodge A winnar is you. Or rather, your choice.
Lazyweb: $5 credit to Amazon MP3 store. What should I buy, Twitter?
Using Ruby to control music software via MIDI & OSC is like plugging together Legos. Too cool. Not needing a rack of gear is even cooler.
@solobasssteve Heh. That's a reason I didn't get a Mighty Mouse. Mice are for /clicking/ not /squeezing/
@jennaddenda If only, Ratamoderat would be great. Or Moderatatat.
New Microsoft bluetooth notebook mouse is smaller than my cellphone. Lawls. Leftclick is unsatisfying though, as it doesn't actually 'click'
@jennaddenda Be sure to check out the album Ellen Allien did with Apparat. Also possibly Moderat. (Modeselektor + Apparat = Moderat.)
@tapps congrats! ^_^
Funny. To up this box to Core 2 Duo @2.8Ghz & 4gigs RAM, it is only $310. Add $90 for a 1Tb drive & it's only $400. Computers are cheap now.
Also, motherboard supports quadcore Intel processors & 4 gigs of DDR2 RAM.  So I guess they're fairly futureproof for a lowend PC build.
@svdodge The real debate is whether to set them up with a Firefox-is-the-UI Linux install. They only know 'the internet' anyways.
@svdodge I can probably shave off $60 if their old HDD and optical drive are still working (their PC is toast). But those would both be IDE.
@svdodge I know. 1.8Ghz Celeron singlecore, 1gig Crucial RAM, 250gig Seagate HDD, DVD burner, microATX case. I assemble it for free. Win.
Grandparents were convinced computers still cost as much as Apple II ($5K). I made a newegg wishlist for a $225 PC, "Can it cost half that?"
Allergies? Bah. May have to call it quits for the day.
Contact lens are acting up again. Really hate this brand, need to research better ones that aren't crazy-expensive.
It is my general opinion that a Twitter client is not important enough that it should consumea majority of resources. Even on my old laptop.
Grabbed Tweetdeck (haven't used it since Leopard install); it is really slow. Even with everything else closed, 40% CPU, 998mb virtRAM used
@blakehall I have Tweetdeck, but loading up twitter.com is faster & I dont like distraction of client constantly updating/whistling/Growling
Thinking that even 130 people is far too many for me to follow on twitter. Sorry, just limited attention & people are using twitter more now
@solobasssteve Not entirely sure that a hardware solution makes sense when my coding-fu is stronger than music-fu. Building tools is fun,too
Thoroughly convinced that no one understands my tweets, so future messages will be in the form: I'M HAVING COFFEE & LOOKING AT STUFF ONLINE.
Not sure what will create the probability matrix for Arkx to use on loops, on the fly. Since it is samples not beats, could be very simple.
One idea: could build up percussive beat w/ loops & have Arkx manage the starting/stopping of those while I play guitar into SooperLooper.
Arkx successfully sent MIDI control to SooperLooper. Started a loop I recorded off internal mic. Not entirely sure how useful this could be.
If you use a UNIX and haven't been reading the SysAdvent blog, maybe now's the time, while everyone is napping:

No one else on the bus. Win. Onward, to shorewood!
Headed home. Waiting for the bus in bayview.
Getting somewhere with my code. Getting a headache, too.
Wow. Completely missed an obvious mistake in the code that was causing errors. Even IMed @distancesoft about it before I found it *facepalm*
@svdodge Are we talking about Nat King Cole here? Because that's a Twitter-discussion I want to be having.
Last.fm is my DJ.
@ashedryden At work.
I forgot what day it was for a minute there. I mean, no I didn't. Gah.
Where by artist I mean musician. Not that musicians aren't artists. Just, err, clarifying.
Zoe Keating was the first looping artist I'd heard, on NPR's Radiolab:  Playing live: 
wut 
OH: "I hope it doesn't start flooding out here"(Germantown) "Yay flooding!"
About to roll over to 44K tracks scrobbled on Last.fm, w00t.
@solobasssteve I think this particular chart illustrates the 'long tail' really well, nearly 500 artists on mine, most under 100 plays
@solobasssteve my lastfm chart: Surprised how many artists I consider good have less than 100 plays for entire yr 
Wondering how many more coasters my Superdrive will burn at 2x before it works for once.
Alterra is empty tonight.
@smutandeggs maybe he's staring at me because of the things I'm saying.
@smutandeggs wut
I've had enough discussion about the movie Marley & Me to last a lifetime.
I won a planet earth monopoly boardgame, but that got stolen & per article 5.2 of the revised 2008 rules, i unwapped a weird USB travel mug.
OH: "Put the hat on, put the hat on. We want a picture." gah i'm gonna be here forever
After three delegations and two wikis to determine the rules, the annual Smith gift exchange event begins with a bang: a train that ever ...

@smutandeggs on last.fm I'm 
Stuck with a "chicken or the egg" problem in my code. Wondering if I need to "import evolution;"
@ashedryden Kill it with fire it's the only way to be sure!
Oh man. So many cookies and brownies and other bakery leftover from Christmas. And I ate way too many of them.
@VideoVillain these look great! 
@gilesgoatboy That's why I avoid getting a TV/xbox/gaming PC. But I'm pretty extreme in cutting things that aren't a good use of my time.
OH: "yes. you need a set of placebo girls"
@blissdev duck duck goose?
Tonight on @mathiasx-a-vision: Hacking eyeglasses for more speed and greater L2 Cache.
For the record, I really liked the tiger sysprefs over leopard's. It doesn't help that two things that used to /just work/ don't today.
They find new ways to challenge my patience every time. Tonight it is ravioli with no sauce b/c "vegetarians cant eat tomato sauce"
I did get my grandparents a Linksys wireless router at Best buy, though, so now I can be online at their house. They were not amused?
I told them I can't get parts if the hardware fails in the future & can't help them much with Vista. At least I've got them using Firefox.
Hrm, my grandparents ended up going to Best Buy, they bought a Gateway w/ AMD quadcore, Vista & in a SFF case. Oh well.
managed to kill my ipod, somehow. great.
Adding cayenne and cinnamon to the next cup of ginger+lemon tea. Should knock the cold right into the next county.
Attacking cold with double-strength fresh-ginger-root-&-lemon-tea.
Huh, Honda is bringing back the Insight Hybrid, but not an aluminum hatchback Civic (which the old one was), it looks like a bad Prius clone
Sinus Headache? Check. Enlarged lymph nodes in neck? Check. Inflamed tonsils? Check. Saying I'd be in for work today: Err... Working on it.
@smutandeggs The kind of people out to catch vegetarians up in some sort of logical fallacy, they ask "Can you eat this?" for every food.
To my dad: "Don't worry about vacuuming the new rug. We live in the future. I have robots that do that for me now."
My apartment, cleaned up and with new rugs, looks really nice. Comfortable, even.
@trodrigues Or try some doing things in emacs for awhile (a few weeks, maybe), to keep seeing different ways to use an editor.
My new favorite site: 
@nic0 It hit me once during filming a  sketch. If there hadn't been a reception desk there, I'd have fallen over.
@nic0 Inner-ear/balance fail?
It is *now* officially humidifier season, in my apartment, even.
Inner-ear fail: Sudden dizziness followed by nearly falling over.
@ashedryden We've always been at war with Oceania. I mean, the Reds.
@ashedryden It's not the movie from the 50's with the same name, and dozens of people have recorded it. Need the version in my head, though.
I'm guessing it was during the end credits of a movie I watched a lot. IMDB is drawing blanks, I haven't seen any of the movies it lists.
@distancesoft English. Although learning lyrics to Les Feuillies Mortes might be worthwhile. Or Hojas Muertas. ;) (courtesy of imdb.com)
Trying to figure out what movie I must have picked up all the lyrics to Autumn Leaves from, because I certainly haven't ever owned the song
In new Hulk movie, was "Mr. Blue" that Bruce Banner chats with supposed to be Beast from X-Men?  (A Kelsey Grammar cameo was too expensive?)
@trodrigues I'm just putting together a URL string and going there, nothing fancy (no API stuff). I need to make it convert punctuation tho.
@spellcheque I can understand, though. In the past I could only fit in 1 or 2 credits to meet 18 when I wanted to take a 4cr class.
@spellcheque 18 credits is lots; figure 2x as many hours studying outside of class for every 1hr in class: 36 hrs + 18hrs = 54hrs/wk school
New ubiquity command: "lastfm artist" will do a music search on last.fm for an artist of your choosing. Not ready for release yet, though.
Mining Bert Jansch's guitar style for ideas, other folk records to follow.
@lvanlysal My gravity points down, so it would make using the sinks interesting.
@gilesgoatboy Hrm that doesn't work after all. Disregard. I'll figure it out later when I have time.
@gilesgoatboy To block those annoying IntelliTxt in-text ads as well, block vibrantmedia.com in /etc/hosts
Working on cleaning out old stuff that needed to be cleaned out, other things in apartment. Luckily fresh ginger+lemon tea is a cold killer.
Sidewalks are like an ice rink today. Luckily i didn't sprain my wrist when i fell. Shouldnt even be out on foot today.
Trying to figure out what the big deal with Bon Iver is, in the 6AM dark, staring at the snow out his back window.
Can't sleep or the grue will eat me.
Straight-up fresh ginger tea, after about an hour of doodling on guitar and trying looping. Needs more work.
If anyone's interested in some RPM Challenge stuff, get in touch via DM. kthxbai. Time for sleep, I think.
Which reminds me, I still need to get a copy of 
@svdodge I think the motion graphics were supposed to look like a Miles Davis album cover? Or at least something off Blue Note Records?
There was a time when my little brother and I communicated only via emailed LOLCATS images. I miss those days.
@Oshuma  record-an-album-in-a-month the same as NaNoWriMo is write-a-novel-in-a-month 'contest'
This Trader Joe's veggie pizza with asparagus and green beans is different & very good.
Well, correction, @raster's blog post reminded me.
Man, @raster just reminded me that the RPM Challenge is right around the corner. Dunno if I'll be ready for it.
@nungana good luck in Tokyo!
@Teecycle_Tim Doesn't that break the attempt to sequester you in isolation of outside opinions?
Sleep is elusive.
@ckittel That movie inspired my two *nix computer's hostnames for a long time, way back when.
Time to jet, as much as one can 'jet' by taking a bus ride commute home.
Must've uninstalled OpenOffice.org from work machine; realized that I couldn't open powerpoint files that are needed for this project.
Just churned out a bunch of stuff for work. At least I think it's a lot, compared to my recent productivity. We'll see tomorrow.
@svdodge Are you going to be tweeting your progress in an attempt to keep motivated/in the habit?
New week at work, in a new year. New stuff to work on, as soon as I get my build environment up. Grr, error msgs that tell me nothing useful
@svdodge Err, correction, I don't answer calls from unknown local #s. 800/900 numbers I can google fast enough to figure out what they are.
Seriously people, I don't answer my phone. If you can't leave a voicemail, I'm not going to pick it up on the 4th or 5th attempt to call me.
T-Mobile: My I'll-buy-a-G1-if-you-cover-Milwaukee-in-3G offer still stands. You're not holding up your end of the deal though.
Didn't know if I liked the new Ubiquity look, but now I'm in love with it.
Sometimes coding entails being a monkey with a hammer randomly banging on parts until they break. Not that I don't enjoy this task.
Need to record all the hissing, pinging, burbling, gonging and whistling that my building's radiators+pipes do. Might be useful to sample.
@blissdev @littletinyfish @joshjs You guys going to do this for RPM Challenge in Feb? Either way, I want a review copy.
Since I've gotten home, I've accomplished nothing and it was WONDERFUL.
@cheshster I didn't come to Milwaukee for practicing, I came for adventure!
@DerKlaus Will any crossroads do?
Someone please assure me that expensive guitar gear will make me a better player, despite evidence that blues legends all played $10 guitars
@ckittel Isn't that a music-rhythm game to begin with, though? Defeats the point to turn the music in the game off & listen to other music?
@ckittel needs moar METAL
OH: "I have his phone number if you want to email him." "You can't email over phone numbers." &gt;.&lt;
@trodrigues Yeah, the USB chipset probably doesn't support it.
@trodrigues smartctl to print out error logs for that device.
Err, 'POD feels like' as in, that's all the company Line 6 cares about anymore.
@lakeicychill And the Korg REMS always sounded better than the POD et al. Plus, I think POD only feels like modeling nu-metal distortion now
@lakeicychill Actually, a discontinued Korg digital multi-effects box. I used to make analog pedals so I'm biased, but I need lots of sounds
@Tmtx I don't currently subscribe to any commands, just have my own in the Command Editor. Dunno why that would be, sorry.
Now to wait for more 6 day auctions to get close to finishing so I might have some CLUE as to what I might consider bidding..
@svdodge hah. a company doing something at would earn it less money. That'll be the day.
@heygabe @svdodge the problem is, the out-of-production guitar gear I'm trying to snag isn't exactly available at amazon.com
eBay really pisses me off. Buy It Now's are way out of proportion to what auctions are actually closing for, in this case, 3x the price.
Work workd.
The milwaukee public works trucks remind me of the trucks in night watch/day watch. Only, not Russian & not fighting vampires.
@svdodge Back when they were one of the few tiny little ultraportable notebooks. Had Transmeta Crusoe CPUs & a swiveling camera in the hinge
It's pretty bad when HP makes a better Vaio than Sony. (See: HP Mini 2140 netbook vs. Vaio P) Then again, Vaios haven't been cool for years.
My laptop sleeps more reliably than I do. Insomnia is the stupidest affliction ever.
Still can't figure out what the deal with Bon Iver is. It's not that it is particularly good OR bad, it's just meh.
Wondering who the 140th person I follow will be. Because it's a self-referential-twitter thing and aren't-I-so-clever. gah.
Another night of not accomplishing much. Too quiet in here tonight.
@distancesoft Because I'm on IRC, constantly. I have it directly wired into my brainstem.
@TheMosey Your sin? That's what you call your son?
"we'll make a future in thermodynamic futures"
@spellcheque 
21:49 &lt; mathiasx&gt; BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING MY TWITTER.
@lakeicychill "This is the challenge: record an album in 28 days, just because you can"  Or, nanowrimo for music
@joshjs Correction. I know @joshjs who knows musicians.
Wondering why I don't know any musicians here in Milwaukee. I know @tapps, but @tapps is probably far too busy for my RPM Challenge stuff.
@solobasssteve Thx. Your endorsement is enough to justify it, and it isn't even that expensive :D
@solobasssteve Have anything to say on using the ART TubeMP? They've got a 'studio' version for $30 and I might be recording vocals in Feb..
The sirens are fitting. Everything is chaos here.
@littletinyfish Can't really do the used furniture thing. My allergies are pretty terrible. I'm gonna go to Ikea for a couch in March, tho.
Considering buying expensive Crate&Barrel junk to fill my empty apt, which I'll keep buying in an attempt to fill the empty void in my SOUL.
@ashedryden Why shouldn't I expect to excel at everything I attempt? I'm me.
Forgot my sweater today, and so Murphy says it is cold. Brr.
@lakeicychill Problem is, I want the digital multiFX just so I can get /enough/ FX in time for RPM.
@lakeicychill Wade's is across the street from my apartment, there's a music store across from my work.
@web414 wishing i had cards to give out to point him to the meeting tonight. (had i been able to get up there)
Former professor got onto the crowded bus; i'm hidden in the back. He briefly pulled out 'javascript: the good parts' to read

@Teecycle_Tim Twitter is the perfect platfrm for sharing cool stuff; I dont think it annoys anyone. Social media users are good at filtering
@Teecycle_Tim Good stuff. Been enjoying your links to music all day.
Steel hollowbodied electric guitars, absolutely gorgeous and probably unique sound:  
"Because just like stripes make your car go faster, cowboy shirts make me play acoustic guitar better" -- me
I want to build a whole framework on Ubiquity & Javascript. Needs nextgen threaded JS in Firefox tho. Already too much JS in webapps I use.
@svdodge I'm a professional wrestler.
Eggplant Parmesan for lunch from @distancesoft, with some Adagio White Monkey green tea. Yum.
@sarandipity I ride the 15 all the way from Shorewood to Bayview, so I definitely go past it on the west end of Brady there. Hmm.
GTalk is a better group chat engine than Campfire. Now to just write a SVNbot that spams us commit log updates via Jabber. Whee.
@svdodge Page 2 of that article contains the song mashup flash thing I linked earlier.
OH: "That's not how you spell Quiche"
@sarandipity I always try to look for your store on the bus ride down Brady, and I always miss it.
Make your own mashup song flash app. Groovy. 
Bon Iver's new stuff on myspace is full of vocal autotuning. Not a fan.
I've never been motion sick before, but spent the whole bus ride experiencing it. Slowly sipping coffee to ward off the subsequent headache.
@trodrigues Are those equivalent to "yeah", "umm", "like" etc?
After midnight, we gonna let it all hang out..
Need to focus. But maybe just go to sleep instead.
@svdodge I think the Macbook Air is a nice compromise between screen size and overall size, winning thinness and lightness, losing on price.
Err, gah. Retract last statement. I guess I was thinking of hte new 13" Macbook.
@svdodge The Macbook Air is so much lighter than the 12", and every time you go to watch video on the tiny screen you'll want widescreen.
@avanhizzle is the 140th person I follow. Twitterential. Congrats, or something.
@jf The signal loss would be so great & TCP wouldn't work as it couldn't go back in time to tell the router what it lost. Nice idea though.
Tea and guitar for awhile, I think. Nice quiet, snowy night alone.
Added a gig of RAM to 12" Powerbook. Polishing a turd, perhaps, but it should help maintain my Firefox many-tabs-addiction.
Time to head home, trying to follow the @factoryjoe mantra of "This can all be made better. Ready? Begin."
Time to take off. Barely feels like the weekend, the week flew by so fast for me.
@littletinyfish Souped that image.  let me know if you want different attribution.
OH: "And how much is a stamp these days?" "Eight dollars."
The Mamas & The Papas' California Dreamin' makes winter days like today gresatt
Seems like I get another idea for a song in the shower every morning. At this rate I'll be ready with actual songs for Feb's RPM Challenge.
Trader Joe's instant oatmeal is awesome.
Winter here is nice, compared to where I grew up: Not having to worry about the pile of wood running out before Spring & freezing to death.
@tronathan I really enjoyed it. Thank you for leading things.
At web414. Where are you?
I find it funny that @svdodge is getting @replied by a bunch of international @TheMosey clones in various languages.
Having trouble saving a Yahoo Pipe. hrm.
I dunno. I personally don't care about the Palm Pre.
@ashedryden just named my Roomba 'Bowie' because I insisted it is genderless.
A roomba is a pet that I'm allowed to ignore for most of the week.Also allowed to hit it with rolled up newspaper when it gnaws on furniture
@svdodge Refurb MBP. The Core 2 Duos are so much more powerful, and the thing won't overheat with 4 tabs open in Firefox.
Resetting the breakers does nothing; no old fuses. Bldg managers aren't home; realty company is closed. Maintance accept emails for 'nex ...
Just blew a fuse; no idea where the box is and hoping it is just a breaker. No idea where i'd buy an oldfashioned fuse.
Meh. Blogged about RPM Challenge gear here: 
Ubiquity wishlist: insert-in-place Thesaurus command, so that I can scroll through list of hits and replace the word in rich text fields.
Realizing I've become intolerably random and disorganized. I think information overload is to blame. Closing all tabs in 3.. 2.. 1..
@ashedryden You use or quit services based on the design of their favicon? I would think, you know, functionality might be a higher priority
Apparently the people trying to get audio apps to run well on Linux are using real-time kernels (normally used in embedded devices). Cool!
Reading a forum where the members are solely devoted to running music apps on netbooks. Renoise 2 is apparently quite good on Atom CPUs.
Ideas for cooling down my (top-floor) apartment? Radiators off, windows can't be opened. Hall is same temperature & no air is moving around.
Coffee? Coffee. Right then.
Socks in Strategic Places second album: Lord of the Dead. (This is what happens when you mistype Lord of the Rings-&gt;LotR as LotD, kids.)
@distancesoft I just finished eating at the Humbolt Alterra. Hanging out with @ashedryden, @VideoVillain and @svdodge.
Presenting Socks in Strategic Places' first album, Only Applications of Science.
Band name: "Socks in Strategic Places"
My brain. it is lame.
@blissdev Digging that link as well RT @blissdev Enthralled by 1001 Rules for my unborn son - 
Up since 6:30, and I figured if I'm going to be awake this early, I might as well be practicing guitar. So I am.
eying the cellphone hungrily. must have more parts! sadly it is probably all surface mount parts.
Doing the mad scientist thing. Tiny bits of electronics EVERYWHERE.
Apparently one can simply place a towel or blanket over radiator to help manage (over)heating apartment. Adjust to taste. Who knew?
Power situation is resolved. I feel dumb for not knowing essential home-repair knowledge.
Multitasking at home: Doing dishes while I put in a load of laundry, while dinner is cooking. Roomba is running. Off to get groceries soon!
@distancesoft err. Wine. That's what I meant. No win would be fail. And fail is bad. I failed right there. Autoposted to failbog and such.
@distancesoft re: Daniel Fast. " no meat or win" -&gt; Sounds like veganism + straightedge. Who knew the Old Testament was full of punks?
@solobasssteve @lobelia sorry I had to go during the break in your ustream concert. sounded great tonight! will stay in touch.
Watching RT @purplecar: @solobasssteve going live here: 
@smutandeggs zomg this is great! thanks :D
Dear Microwave: please don't throw the circuit breaker. again. Srsly. I'm your biggest fan; you provide me with warm meals. Don't screw up.
Starting a hobocore band with a guy on met on the bus who had a garbage bag full of cans. Calling it the 151st Drum and Banjo Corps Jug Band
Today is full of static shocks.
Silliness from this morning: "Highlander 5: The Meatening" (must eat meat to stay immortal; 80's guitar solos & lightning when eating bacon)
Debating whether I want to go to Soup Market for lunch or not. Hmm. This trail mix isn't cutting it as a 'meal'
Eating Thai banana crisps, polishing up some code.
OH: "Who set the error message to 'Working out a few kinks'?" "[Guy1]'s got a few kinks." ... "Leave my personal life out of this."
@littletinyfish Ok. Let me know when you'd like to do that.
@svdodge I'm not going to shave until the album is done and February is over, unless I want to keep it. Same beard I was sporting on Sunday.
If 2008 has proven anything, it is that beards make for better indie music.
@VideoVillain happy birthday. you know, people should celebrate these birthday things or something...
My evening is now complete: 
@ashedyden isn't letting me record my 50 minute one-take doom-metal-tronica album full of fuzzy, distorted guitars through crazy reverb. Hrm
@distancesoft I noticed eVince has trouble figuring out what workspace on the cube to launch on, but it is fine with Beryl/Compiz off. YMMV.
@distancesoft AIR can't do Growl either. It's frustrating.
Traumatized for life by my neighbor.
@raster Oh that won't work. What you need there is a Mac Pro. Preferably top of the line.
@distancesoft Bus ride is taking forever. Will be really late today.
Nice night in, watched a movie with @ashedryden and @smutandeggs. Things are winding down for me, need sleep.
RW Co-op is playing the Kill Bill soundtrack. &lt;3
Hiring a fleet of Sherpas to guide me on the journey to Riverwest in this bitter cold. Wrapped in twenty layers of yak-wool; smelly but warm
@MusicThing Everyone wants that thing. Just as long as autotuned vocals doesn't become any more popular than it already is.
Anyone know a music major who could help me get practice rooms booked at UWM in Feb? I figure this is worth a shot.
Backing up iTunes library in preparation for a TuneApp run (Supposedly the best ID3 tag cleaner out there)
I'll admit I had no clue why the kid was shouting at me, initially. He got his wires caught on me while he moved down aisle. I was oblivious
Home sweet home. Got caught up in a kid's headphones in the aisle & he was angry enough to rip the y-strap off my bag & throw fake punch ...
Notes to self: add hood back to jacket, wear thicker hat & gloves, another sweater, and get insulated pants even if they looksilly. Bitt ...
@svdodge I dig your new avatar-of-the-moment. I bet @VideoVillain will enjoy it too.
@joshjs May I suggest a 15-minute Google Appengine site using that RSS feed? :D
@joshjs re:RSS feed of potential band names. Subscribed!
@joshjs Follow-up: last.fm artist link of the day  ;)
@CDavis That Ubuntu is the devil's computing. Heaven forbid a non-Windows computer can't install Windows software. Glad she didn't get a Mac
@TheMosey Crunches on exercise ball while holding the medicine ball doesn't sound so bad. I need to start weight training anyways.
@jdavid Ubiquity demands you get an aircard then. "Ask not what Ubiquity can do for you, but what you can do for Ubiquity."
@KeVroN @joshjs I humbly submit the name I've been using for the past year for your approval: Naphtha Winters. Only, you know, not fake band
Given this bulletin board full of concert fliers, apparently I should start going to the $10 shows at Turner Hall.
@Narkalant needs some hobbies, apparently.
@ashedryden Sounds like brain bleeding. Make sure when you go to a hospital tell them it is due to an on-the-job accident!
Today at @mathiasx's desk: When Allergies Attack.
@tapps @solobasssteve ROADIECONS, TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT.. to get my luggage and bass.
@raster But we do that every day, in groups of 3 or more.
I'm the office coffee snob. It's official. (So much for that 3 week attempt at quitting coffee)
@brandonmorreale Just had brown rice with black bean salsa over the top. Was supertasty. My favorite quick meal is Jamaican beans & rice.
(switching to Kelvin units makes it seem so much warmer right now)
It's so cold, my Gnome taskbar weather app is broken. Displays -0.00000
@PaulGrahamRaven Sounds like a good idea. Much better to lock it there than the nut like my old Floyd-equipped Strat, I'll bet.
@solobasssteve will we get a video tour some time?
OH: "We should have cold days.. just like 'snow days' only... cold."
Wondering if everyone will start following  b/c @al3x replied to @capotej, who mentioned it. Let decoding commence!
@corbenfrost I learned my lesson last night waiting for the bus,  wore 1000 layers today.
@PaulGrahamRaven planetwaves locking tuners?
@distancesoft and I don't have stand-up meetings. We have stand-up-reminisce-about-Slashdot-in-the-old-days discussions.
iPod earbuds really can't do the Special Low Frequency versions of Boris albums justice. And no, I don't let my ripper filter the low freqs.
@PaulGrahamRaven I thought I was the only one? Well, with the leatherman. I've a pair of clippers in each guitar case/bag. Nice for strings.
@joshjs Thanks. Your input has saved me $90 I think.
My hair is crazy today due to thick wool hat pulling on it while it was wet. I like it.
@solobasssteve have fun at NAMM!
#lazyweb: Flip a coin. Heads or tails? This helps me decide something.
@svdodge I like the Moleskine 'Cahiers' that are just slightly smaller than an index card, 40 pages + 10 tear-out pages I think. Softcover.
@smutandeggs That's why I will burn you a copy ;)
It's not that cold outside, actually.
I need a tshirt that says my new catchphrase, "I MAKE THE COOL" on it. Stat. That's doctor-speak.
Total spent on amazon.com (including marketplace) in 2008: $533.01, ouch! Spent so far on Amazon in 2009, w/new guitar gear for RPM: $151.14
Right. Getting away from the computer, holing up with newly-tuned acoustic and writing songs about sea captains with peg legs and beards.
@darrickhartman Macmini can't do eSATA without me hacking the internal connector out through the fan vents. So, don't think that will work.
External hard drive is making too many loud (death)clicks for my comfort. Preemptively shopping for external Firewire HDD's.
Dear radiators: die. My guitars are drying out, they'll crack & I'll be very angry. Plus you make me sweat. On coldest day of year so fa ...
Oh man, the clarity of the individual notes on this thing is amazing. My cheap playing doesn't do it justice. And of course it booms & roars
Throwing caution to the wind, stretching a new pair of strings on my 1973 dreadnought acoustic, which needs a luthier's touch on its bridge.
Now everything except for Firefox isn't responding, including the taskbar, demanding me to hard reboot. Hrm. A sign that I should upgrade?
Oh nevermind, TuneUp.app only works on Leopard, my macmini (aka jukebox) is still on Tiger. Where's my Liger? :&gt;
Woke up to cold and pain. Half my apartment warm, the other half very cold. Can't say much about the pain on twitter . Re-attempting sleep.
Need to unsubscribe from so many feeds.. maybe I'll do that some other time when I have time and energy to do so...
Cool airship:  Word.
Digging Andrew Bird's live looping stuff, especially the instrumentals on the bonus disk to Noble Beast. @solobasssteve should check it out.
@jbdryden I lurn wright gud?
The hard frost is starting to melt off the portholes. Cap'n Roberts said we can aloft to the aether 'fore sunset, with the coal fires stoked
@raster thanks for the mention. I'm much more prepared this year for RPM :&gt;
@littletinyfish Panniers?
@spellcheque 2nding the vinegar instructions from @lakeicychill
@Natesologuitar I just saw @solobasssteve ^ @lobelia play here in WI last month. Great fun :D
@cswingler I only ever went to Wischau's on the north end of Main Str. For oil change I know places NOT to go, had a place destroy an engine
Ze song of the moment: Bookworm by Margot & the Nuclear So and So's
Saved a few bucks buying something on eBay($9 shipping) instead of on Amazon(free shipping).. not sure that it was all worth the hassle.
In Oak Creek, WI.
The snow falls beautifully.
My brother can't come for RPM Challenge. Need someone willing to hang out, man the recordbutton, sing occasionally, on weeknights & wknds :D
@AlKrueger There's a nice outdoor velodrome in Kenosha. Don't know if it is 'Olympic' or not- over 100 years old, pavement is rough in spots
Attacked by some kind of snow ninja! But a big cup of coffee acquired and errands run. Warming up in my too-warm chalet.
Wondering whether i can trust a 69 cent ruler for something that needs millimeter accuracy
I love my boots, running and jumping in the snow shouldn't be so easy with 10lbs on each foot. They're hunting boots by way of Army & GSG9's
My glasses, they are a deflector shield between your passive aggressiveness and my social awkwardness. Too bad they're cracked.
Oddly enough, I'm excited that it has *warmed up* to 15 degrees F.
Worse is that I can't regex across the txts or say "Delete all txts from Contact List entry Twitter"
Cleaning out my cellphone's txts because it complains that it is full. I shouldn't have to do this, we live in the future!
@raster Good to hear, I think I need to get my audio interface sorted soon. Not sure if Amazon is ever gonna ship the USB Behringer thing.
This not-sleeping thing is a real drag on my sleeping.
@joshjs OMG SPOILERS by letting me know that they finally answer something.
@JoeSteve Particularly recommend: Changing Colours and I Become Awake, but whole thing is worth grabbing.
@JoeSteve Yep. That's the first track. So many good songs on the album though.
My album find of the week: Great Lake Swimmers - Ongiara
Found little socks with traction tread on the bottom, dunno where they're from. Feet are warm & not slipping on hardwood floors. Double win?
Landlord woke me up from a nap (almost was a full night of sleep). Compelled to clean up guitars & apt now b/c they're coming back tomorrow
@CDavis Any chance you'll be doing RPM Challenge this year? www.rpmchallenge.com record an album in a month in the vein of NaNoWriMo.
3D glasses freakout here. Everything is sudden like DEVO.
OH: "It's a knit beard holder."
Free pancakes at my place, too. Well, in a bit. We have to go shop for some fruit and syrup.
Plenty warm in my apt today. Come on over, avoid the crowds at Alterra. Free coffee, too :D
Enamored with the idea of  and dreaming up ways to build a web app that is Milwaukee/WI-specific.
Liptons pyramid-bag teas aren't half bad actually. Drinking the lemon black tea.
Quoting The Fifth Element, to an empty apartment, early on a Sunday morning: my life in a nutshell.
OH: Emo in the front, parrty in the back.
Where 'apply' means to take it out of my bank account, without my permission, even though I've asked to have my card taken off their records
Speakeasy 'applied' $353 on Dec8 for fees they said they'd drop. Today, they decided I'm past due on $217 & threatening to 'apply' it. Help?
Goodbye beard. It was time for a change. Hello razor burn.
watching iTunes visualizations in a darkened room. Wearing one of the ubiquitous pairs of cheap cardboard 3D glasses that now litter my apt.
Randomly stumbled upon this on a random last.fm profile: "x’s Library (1,337 artists)" lol. nice.
this is not productive what am I doing hurr hurr &lt;/jephjacques-style-freakout&gt;
My most recent tweet cloud is pretty boring. Not that tweet clouds are very interesting other than for vanity ://tinyurl.com/6l6zxd
Boy, I sure hope those hammering noises in the building over last 3hrs, are constructing something awesome like a water slide. Oh boy!
Keying in my Amazon giftcard from all the change I put into the Coinstar machine earlier today. Coinstar++
home. bus pass acquired. time to decide what to make for dinner.
brb need to go get bus pass for the week. grrr MCTS, grrr.
Via @warrenellis, "Supposedly, January 19 is statistically the grimmest and most hopeless day of the year - Blue Monday."
Often I wonder about the footsteps I hear coming from the ceiling.Then I remember I'm on the top floor & let the ghosts get back to waltzing
And I've been repeatedly told by their billing people that until it gets sorted out, I needn't pay up, as I'd end up with a credit. They lie
If you go by Twitter alone, I'm having the most boring week ever.
Breaking radio silence briefly for a moment of zen 
@fragmad Life needs moar REPL?
Life doesn't get syntax highlighting, as much as I'd love to have a little red squiggly underneath when something starts going wrong.
@svdodge V0 is the only way to rip!
New studio headphones. Broken Social Scene - Broken Social Scene. EVERYTHING COMES OUT OF THE MIX *esplodes*
A bus is terrible place to be in a zombie attack.
Full lights & sirens. They're headed somewhere else now. Blaming zombies preemptively.
roughly 6 sherriff tahoes flew up and down KK about 4 times bwfore blocking road ahead of bus. not sure what theyre after
The hilarity at Distance HQ right now is kind of overwhelming. Can't say why.
No one does Beatles songs better than The Beatles. Represent.
@raster I approve and would like to participate in any album inspired by Sleep, Om, Boris, Sunn O))), etc
So spoiled by my hot water, that I brush my teeth with it, even. Yes. Who wants that weird root canal feeling from cold water anyways?
Being attacked by the sun through my office window.
@svdodge @littletinyfish Thinking I need to get out while the sun is good. Wishing I had a bike stashed down here in Bayview to ride home on
Mmm. Fresh pot of Alterra blue heeler.
Lazyweb: What's the soundtrack for today? (artist, album, etc) Shuffle just went from Japanther to Nick Drake. Not a smooth transition.
Gah. Stupid alarm clock. Probably time I coded a wake-up script myself. Just woke up & now time for lunch.. Super-late to work. Awesome day.
The world's locked up in your head /  You've been pouring it a concrete bed /  Your habits ossify /  You don't realize you're fried /
In the words of The Beatles, here comes the sun.
Alternating between cups of coffee and glasses of water today. All told, I drank several gallons, it seems.
Brain in RoR+JS mode: Hair popped back into fauxhawk formation, adopted fake Danish accent, shouting "Look at all the things I'm not doing!"
Aptana's RadRails plugin can't really refactor RoR code like it can Java on Eclipse. Fair warning.
Suddenly freezing cold up at my desk. Oddly enough, it's warmer out than it was before.
@joshjs Yeah. Good album.
@3liza Your sugary corpse will be preserved not unlike the saints scattered about Europe. From the preservatives &other industrial chemicals
Everyone seems to have had the same "No one will want to do laundry after work on a Wednesday night" idea as I had. Tiny laundry room packed
Just tripped over a guitar stand in the dark,. Then when I was cursing and stumbling around, I ran into the armchair. Coordination fail.
Things accomplished at home today: Putting in a load of laundry: 2mins, shuffling papers around desk: 2 mins, tweaking iTunes EQ: 15 mins.
Apparently listening to The White Stripes on repeat will turn my head to mush. Who knew? 
The sun is back. My work area is /glowing/
The things I know from QC get me in trouble in conversations.
Being nourished by the phat beats sent my way by @VideoVillain. Who needs lunch anyways, with such hot remixes?
OH: "Why are you not magnetic?"
Beautiful weather. Reeally want to go sledding or snowboarding or biking or /something/
Contact mic on window glass pane -&gt; Sing into it. Interesting effect, for future reference. Picks up a lot of road noise outside though.
This wind outside my apartment may end up being the real star of my RPM album.
@calebhawkins re:ART TubeMP: I'm getting a good sound out of the included tube. Thinking it's a Sovtek, not sure. Haven't peeked inside yet.
Can't decide whether to put the Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinkys or Regular Slinkys on my SG for February. Choices, choices.
Getting setup for RPM, which means getting messy: 
Off to get some coffee and go for a walk. Beautiful out today, warmer but still below freezing.
I'm still in denial that Doctor Who's Tennant-cy is over.
Tendons in my left hand are complaining loudly. I guess 4-5 hours of guitar, when you haven't been playing, is too much.
Setting up gear for RPM Challenge. Really love the ART TubeMP preamp; going to use it for both vocals and guitar, in lieu of a guitar amp.
Hogging the laundry room tonight.
@chrisjaure Yeah. Or peel it with a potato peeler and slice thin. Think of pickled ginger that comes with sushi -- you want it that thin.
@chrisjaure Try fresh ginger root + lemon tea. Possibly supercharge it with honey, cinnamon, and cayenne, to taste.
Headed down to Roast. Another beautiful day, but one that requires much coffee.
Guitar adds up quick. Oh well, new strings, onespot & cables for RPM in Feb. from Wade's on Oakland
Oh man, guy with the most awesome moustache ever. Dunno if i can spycam a shot.
Cursing the possibly-curved neck on my SG, because it's obviously a setup problem and not my weak fingers making that buzz, fo' sure. Bah.
Playing a gypsy tune on tiny travel guitar, steel strings snapping, making the faeries dance to minstrel songs. Cold medicine. Good stuff.
Results are unimpressive. May need to just go buy a brass kazoo.
Going through a big bag of (new!) combs to find a perfect wax paper kazoo.
Bus ride is just long enough to write a 4 verse song. Walk from bus to apartment is just long enough to forget most of it.
Feel like i just coughed up something from The Fly starring Jeff Goldblun. Strangely not sick with a cold or anything.
@cheshster @Narkalant Mercury consumption is approved by your local Mad Hatters union.
Probably a shorter way to do this, but: $ cat .bash_history | cut -f1 -d" " | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
Envious that piano players get a B-chord for no additional cost, while I can never pull it off. Not double-jointed in my pinky finger.
This morning's fun new sensation is brought to you by partially dislocating my shoulder. I think it's fixed now though..
Some inspiration for you RPMers: 
RPM Challenge progress today: None. Busy, slightly sick, lacking a solid idea for what to work on, so far. Hoping I get inspired this week.
Shouting in the building that went out to the back alley. Wonderful. Just like old times.
Phantom cellphone syndrome: The feeling that your phone is ringing in your pocket, when the cellphone itself is not there.
Still no new glasses. Thinking the company has absconded off to vacation in Mexico on my meager glasses-money, never to be heard from again.
I'm guessing its for a myspace profile, lawl. I'm all for public photography but this is kind of annoying. Want to be home.
Photoshoot on the bus, making people move fromk his seat & pretending to read a paper? Weird, kind of a jerk.
@ashedryden I think we'll need to go to Minnesota, because they have BAAAAARNs, to learn this.
@svdodge @blissdev This just in: not old, that's just well-aged beef. Or pork. I haven't had meat in so long I forgot which animal is what.
Still make the \o/ when I make the shot into the trashcan at my desk. Also, this just in, still 12 years old.
OH: "I know Apache isn't /that/ magic."
@pfhawkins I'm fairly certain is due to the 404 errors I get on google domains about 1 in 20 times. Breaks gtalk-in-gmail and needs refresh.
The phrase "gmail fail" has become a new greeting for me, on GTalk, explaining why I suddenly disappeared in the middle of an important talk
My work computer is moody some days, so we named it Lithium. Not at all because the hostname scheme already called for Hydrogen and Helium.
"my true skills lie in say, burning your name into the moon with a giant laser" -- @mathiasx
There's scarf thieves about.
Vignettes 1/10: The doctor tells me the test is for meningitis. "Impossible," I say, "I've had my rabies shots." They check my fever again.
@al3x tapir?
@solobasssteve Web app geeks, but that's a really good song.
Going to have to take full credit for the idea of Tiramisuvius: cake and ice cream that erupts hot fudge like a volcano.
It's harder to say the truth than just give up.
Kthx
Beautiful weather today.
Arrays are the pirates of the data structure world. "arr!"
Apparently I need a twitter-DM-aware phone. Or a twitter-DM-aware operator.
Even trying to relax can lead to stressful planning sessions by committee.
My mom won't stop complaining about people I don't know sending nasty email. I tell her the best way to deal with a troll is to ignore them.
Stratocaster (w/ sketchy 80s floyd rose) is holding tuning for the first time in years. Taking advantage of it to play slide through reverb.
Behringer UCA202 audio interface loves my laptop & audacity. go figure it doesn't like the macmini+garageband.
To my mom: "Are you listening to Billy Idol?" Her: "Yeah. It's on this hits compilation album on my iPod." Me: "Wow. Just wow."
"Note that an indicator value of 0 is rare and not useful for determining colinearity because of floating point rounding issues."
Wilco with special guest Andrew Bird, live recording:  as a Quicktime stream. Found my afternoon of music!
Tea and Tubescreamers. Recording rig is /tweaked/

Feeling pretty terrible.
This is my favorote kind of weather. Walking to stone creek.
I want to go sledding, I think. The dangerous, stupid kind of sledding on Rubbermaid ruffneck tote lids in urban environments.
Need an angel investor to purchase a snow shovel for my new shovelling startup, it's snow 2.0! This snow bubble is gonna last forever!
I need to stop listening to music and make my own.
Building a better mousetrap. I mean, fuzz pedal. And by 'building' I mean, "dreaming up the way it'd sound in my head"
Closer examination of the Bear Cavalry image reveals a lute and an accordion. Apparently they're musicians, too. Probably throw a good party
"My name is Matt and I have a browser tab addiction problem..."
OH: Don't judge my judging your judging for me
Sick today wit a cold. Good thing it is my day off!
@Timfastic Congrats man.
@joshjs &lt;napoleon-dynamite&gt; Jealous.. &lt;/napoleon&gt;
@cheshster You called, sir?
OH: so apparently testicles are heaters.
I need a tailor. And a Taylor.
@smutandeggs you're safe.
unfollowing frenzy is simply because I still can't keep up with twitter. gaaah.
@smutandeggs HONEY! THEY MAKE THE WASHER IN TEAL!
I'll be downtown dressed as a beggar, with the sign asking for Wilco tickets and complaining that space aliens stole my last tix.
Fairly convinced all the large, flat-topped buildings I see in Ottawa on google maps sat photos are minor league hockey arenas. Fairly.

Hahaha. Snowmergency 2009! It's every man for himself! Mad Max in snow! (on ice?) This guy next to me is hilarious.
Hahaha. Snowmergency 2009! It's every man for himself! Mad Max in snow! (on ice?) This guy next to me is hilarious.
Finally on a bus. Packed. This isn't even that much snow. Rediculous.
Still no buses. 8 have passed me going north though. Can only imagine they stopped at bayshore for coffee. Or fell off the face of the earth
Buses going south are delayed at least 25mins. Saw 6 buses going north on this line
Recumbents are the new hipster bike of choice this year, now that they've figured out you can strap two kegs of cheap beer on as panniers.
For every MySpace band page that autoplays their music instead of just preloading it, I shall build a death ray and destroy the planet.
1998 is so last century.
Researching the perfect shade of orange.
Shelving a lot of projects and ideas, including the unfinished RPM Challenge album. Need to focus on more important things.
And on the 6th day, God created the Theremin. And it was good, and he rocked out.
Potential Band Name: O.K. Deer (for my new avant garde jazz-punk trio)
@joshjs Didn't complete it. I ran out of time most days to start recording. Requires very little gear. USB interface to get a mic signal.
@fiddlemath Yeah. She's not a *half ninja*. How lame would that be?
Awesomeness: Youtube remixed into new tracks:  You'll see what I mean..
Potential Band Name: Nitch Goot.
@RyTron Okay! Do you, uhh.. have space in your apartment for me to crash? Indefinitely?
Confirmed that Scott Pilgrim is my life story in manga form. Seriously, it's freaky.
Potential band name: edwardian hotness jacket
@Narkalant Snazzy. Stainless steel appliances ftw.
@smutandeggs Just don't want you to scald your brain.
@smutandeggs I'm pretty sure you don't want hot water in a neti pot. I always do warm out of the tap + salt.
Today looks mostly like this: 
And I forgot it does video, which my cheap interim Verizon MockBerry can't do.
I think I'm going to start carrying my old broken KRZR in airplane mode as a camera. Still holds a charge. Holga-style w/ broken lens FTW.
@smutandeggs we should /totally/ start a band.
@smutandeggs *throws the rock horns*
Hoping for a zombie apocalypse right about now. Not really looking forward to eating all those MREs though.
Stopping at fuel cafe for a second to get burritos to go, w/ my little brother.
Have passed 3 fires that were blocking the road (firetrucks, ambulances, etc) on our way home.
OH: Next time THE HULK is publicly dancing, i'll be sure to bring my camera.
@poseurtech I don't have a facebook account. If one comes up, it's not me.
My mom wants to sneak an 18 year old into a bar, because apparently its okay if she does it. Sometimes I have to be the voice of reason.
@Tmtx granted it doesn't have the storage space. But I'd wait and get a pocket hdd later, 320gb-500gb of space, save battery when not in use
@Tmtx Not a bad deal, no. But  is a better deal.
@Tmtx The new revision coming for the Aspire One looks promising, other than that, can't say it's any better than other Atom clonebooks.
super sunny day. perfect.
My hair is slowly turning into Merlin Mann's old look.
Arr pirate kite day.
In the weirdest exchange, she gave me her blender, hairbrush, and all her trust; I gave her a glimpse of my nightmares & a space next to me.
Blocked @BronzeFonz. That thing is embarrassing.
Oh noes @smutandeggs is in my twitter!
OH: On a scale of 1 to 10, that's eyebrows.
At the Yardarm in Racine, WI.
Buying climbing shoes.
@DrNautilus Just saw your tank on the BBC. Congrats, I suppose ;) See you when you get out of the slammer, yeah?
kitty kitty meow meow
no more coffee + cupcakes. 4 hrs of insanity behind me, I realize I can't process refined sugar anymore without subsequent crash & headache.
Having a conversation about beards. I'm still not cool enough to be a Riverwest hippie though.
RW Coop again for breakfast. vegan french toast & back on the coffee wagon.
Music? Maybe.
OH: brb... I have to help my room mate get his nipple ring out...

OH: The white male cobra.
At web414. Completely out of it. Stupid cold.
Anyone want to go the Great Lake Swimmers show in Madison next Thursday? @joshjs? @svdodge?
Wishing I was at the Wilco show
Potential band name addendum: Compass Rose (obvious theme going here)
Potential band name: Compass Star (may actually use this), also: Northern Compass and/or True North (thanks @ashedryden for the last two)
Definitely have a cold. Killing it with fire, it is the only way to be sure.
@svdodge Let me know how the Wilco DVD is. I'm probably going to end up getting it when it comes out.
So apparently being an adult means giving up on all your hopes and dreams and admitting that our consumer greed dictates miserable drudgery.
Hmm. Apparently uploading a new twitter avatar is brokened.
"A real picture of yourself is encouraged. It adds personableness to your tweets."
My mom is apparently time-sharing a horse.
OH: Personally I think it sounds like a geologic formation. Like, "I went spelunking and saw some beautiful transvestites."
This is one of the first events at @bucketworks I've been at where boys are in the minority.
Oh: You're too tall to steal things.
Where's my frakkin' gorilla glue? I have need of bonding.
Cool, Walgreens sent me a giftcard as thanks for being a customer. That's nice of them & unexpected.
@cheshster your new avatar is ftw
Need to dumpster dive some wood today to mount a contact mic in, to make a country/bluegrass style amplified 'stomp box'
Being awake is the opposite of awesome right now? Back to sleep.
@tapps so my sheep has this rash...
@gilesgoatboy That's awesome, actually. Didn't realize you were up to Vegan Master lvl 4 until I went through more of your recent tweets.
@gilesgoatboy tofu, seitan, tempeh, TVP, soy milk/etc, to help where nature doesn't pack in enough protein/gram. just avoid frying fakemeats
Seth Rogan is here at the Coop and talking about defending his dissertation. drinking kombucha tea that tastes too much like wine 4 comfort
 that is all.
@smutandeggs it's actually kind of an old avatar pic but I'm bringin' it back! ;)
Feeling cheated by this recession of the future that web2.0 was accelerating towards, particularly in stuck-in-the-1980's Milwaukee.
Anyone know what places will take compost in Milwaukee? Don't have a yard, getting tired of all the banana skins etc going in trash.
Had an great discussion about ideas/dreams, prompted by complaining about the tech scene being stagnant. Sensing I'm just not hacking enough
o/~ nap time, for @mathiasx, and Geer-ma-neee o/~
Oh mans, #freecomicbookday!
Photocamp means planning Madison hackerspaces, and moving all the cool Milwaukee hackers there. Because Madison has *two* lakes.
Loving *camp theatre at #photocamp.
Oh: i think if it comes from a keg, it is good.
@littletinyfish What's the new bike shop in RW? I need to stop and get a new helmet tonight. Also need to find a place that's open after 5PM
At Alterra on the lake, refueling.
Milwaukee Art Museum is closed today and we're stuck on the lakeshore. Anything else open down here?
New side job: reverse engineering a Yamaha motorcycle ignition control system / computer and building a replacement that works.
Family is here & they dont want to let me talk about hacking, unconfs, & Rw coop. Instead its the dangers of city & whitefishbay girls ODing
At the urban ecology center
I always forget not to wear my bandana into the bank. Not a bandito, kthx.
Making concessions to appease my family. Lost the beard and sideburns.
@rachelness What's the membership cost at the Urban Ecology Center?
@gregtarnoff It is a script for Firefox's Ubiquity. Public version at  but I keep hacking my own personal version.
Thought I was going to rock an all-nighter but suddenly exhausted. 'Night twitterverse.
Warmed up some pita, my brother made me hummus, carrots, and some baby spinach. White tea from Adagio. TWEETING ABOUT MY FOODS AGAIN. DEAL.
@gregtarnoff I am funemployed and even $25 for flickr pro seems like far too much in my current budget.
Flickr won't let me add more photos from PhotoCampMilwaukee because I hit the upload limit for May already. Free account is so annoying.
My apartment's air is full of VOCs and having a bad allergic reaction to them. Thanks for the new carpet mom & dad! :/
My bike is (now) fight.
@littletinyfish Truly Spoken Cycles wasn't open so I had to deal with the place on Locust. Was pricey compared to Amazon for the same stuff.
From this angle, truck appears to be branded a 'DigiCop'. Briefly chuckled at that thought & remembered the 'WebSheriff' that went after TPB
As Paul Erdos said,"a mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems." -- via Mind Hacks by Tom Stafford & Matt Webb
Crashed phone by renamng Twitter's contact entry to #twit (Verizon names things #bal, #pay etc) learned rules, punctuation comes last, b ...
At alterra on humbolt, at least for the next 1.5hrs if anyone wants to join me. Sitting outside, beautiful day. Have lots to catch up on.
New Beatles guitars for Rock Band look awesome.
Taco Tuesday is over. Feel like I've had too much sodium today; there's not enough water right now. RW Coop tacos are so good though.
My brother has a fauxhawk but he doesn't know what a fauxhawk is. Heh.
@atebits_support re:read-only twitter acct. Or if you're like me, plan to create a smart agent that follows people & 'pageranks' tweets/RTs.
Just wish the Amazon search in Ubiquity had book synopsis inline & wasn't constrained to books (maybe have that be amznbook as shortcut)
Milwaukee Public Library's online search really doesn't have much info. With Ubiquity, highlight book title, ubiq, and start typing 'amazon'
@atebits_support I should note that for the past 3months or so I haven't even bothered to keep up on Twitter. Tweetie helps me, doesn't hurt
@atebits_support lol. thanks. I've pared down the people I follow to those I know IRL, mostly, and tweetie does help. +gorgeous UI
Constantly 6 hours behind on twitter now that I've started leaving Tweetie open. OCD makes me want to read them all. Gaah.
Can anyone recommend a speed reading system that actually works? I'd prefer one that I can get a book on through the library, not obscure.
Spammed by my own gmail address. Login indicator doesn't show other IPs; changing pass. Guessing open mail relay. Angry that it's my address
Finally back home from Racine, WI. Coding in bed on a new project, instead of sleeping. Shh.
#Fortunecookie: "You will find your solution where you least expect it."
Correction: Almond milk. Makes for interesting nutty flavor. Be sure not to over-steam it if you try this yourself.
Made a red tea latte (with steamed soymilk) in my little fauxpresso machine. (Caffeine-free for those playing along at home). Tasty.
No free coffee at Stone Creek now, only tomorrow. Forgot my wallet on purpose, so I wouldn't /buy/ coffee. Should've read past the headline.
@gregtarnoff I should probably switch to frothing rather than steaming soymilk and almond milk. Another kitchen appliance I can't afford tho
@gregtarnoff As noted, the almond milk gets funny if you over-steam. (Baristas: I know real milk should be hotter, didn't have enough chars)
@gregtarnoff I steam soymilk & almond milk the same way as real milk, w/ the wand on my fauxpresso machine + a thermometer, to 105 degrees
Sound doesn't work on the Powerbook and I'm trying to code an audio application. Fail. So very very fail right now.
Wise man say, "When you come to end of internet, close browser."
@LukeStory Don't consider their wifi free, esp. when my bank account is overdrawn and so I can't even afford to sit at coffee shops anymore.
It can be a mobile, disorganized hackathon, moving to where there's coffee, wifi, and power. Anyone? #tweetup #milwaukee
hackathon/devhaus in MKE today: let's do this! @-reply if you want in & suggest a location that isn't Humbolt Alterra (no power for laptops)
@gregtarnoff I forgot to recommend this the other day when you were cleaning up your twitter account: 
I'd like plaintext emails from Twitter DMs with the DM's message first, plz.
Hands are shaky. Couldn't use jeweler's screwdriver to tighten glasses. Morning coffee jitters? Nerve damage? Weird.
Spam hashtags trending on twitter.com sidebar. Wonderful. Also, blocking users doesn't remove them from a hashtag's search results.
Wrapping my head around CouchDB internals is going to take more coffee. Anyone else in MKE playing with/using CouchDB?
Realized that slowness of Powerbook was due to setting 'minimum' processor performance on the power adapter. It is now fast but overheating.
@ashedryden is laughing at me for not getting a Michael Jackson song reference.
ln -s @gregtarnoff Admiral\ Tarkin
Is the light cone getting bigger or smaller?
@joshjs Much-delayed response to your greader shared article & tweets: Memorization has its place in learning new things; is also a lost art
@Eleuvox Thanks for the Oxford VSI tip. BTW, do you have any links on your notecard system? I remember you talking about it in the past.
Finding it funny that an older book numbers something "a thousand million" rather than a billion.
Twisting my ankle on a curb only 5 blocks from homw is so tres chic. Ow. Should've biked
@hypnogogic However, we tend to fill the flowspace with interesting people with interesting ideas, and so I'm always glad to attend ;)
@hypnagogic Thanks, but the flowspace is inert. Without Aristotle or Plato, would the Academy at Athens teach me about philosophy or logic?
@svdodge We should talk music some time. I've got a lot of stuff along those lines I've been digging lately.
@trodrigues Is it really needed? I remember not really needing ESD, which PulseAudio replaces.
@raster Example wattage & power costs on Google Answers tells me CRT costs $17/yr in electricity, LCD costs $5.40/yr   
@Narkalant I don't remember you snoring.
@svdodge And show us the passage of time / We're gonna need a montage / Ooh, it takes a montage / Show a lot of things happening at once
@svdodge The hour's approaching to give it your best / And you've got to reach your prime / That's when you need to put yourself to the test
Suggesting to @blissdev that he render all future website designs in the Doom 1 engine, revolving block text with flames, as animated GIFs.
Immersing in the science of learning and memorization, starting with an old Wired article on the SuperMemo algorithm: 
@smutandeggs It's hard to replicate the environment outside of a class: comprehension, reflection, recall, & implementing what I learned.
Madison's airport code is MSN? I wouldn'ty fly into MSN.
Yay free bread @ Fuel.
@raster Actually, for what I'm playing with, there are no textbooks.
@gregtarnoff I've never learned so efficiently as when I was in crunch mode at school. Reading technical books now seems tedious & slow.
People studying from thick textbooks is a painfully visual reminder that I'm not in school. They're learning; I'm not.
Fuel Cafe is playing the Pzizz sleep program over the loudspeakers. Hilarious, really.
Coding things that are lean and numerous; swarms over monoliths.
Only @joshjs will appreciate this: "Your mind isn't a search engine index, it's a poorly implemented regexp processor."
Today on the @mathiasx show: freezing your way to a smarter *you*
Correction: shift-click. My mind is elsewhere today. Ignore me.
@joshjs @blissdev also to clarify that tweet, didn't have enough room: I never want a new window when dragging tabs. I cmd-click new windows
@joshjs macmini is my main PC so only one. If my old Powerbook was still fast I'd still use dual. Usually run laptop off to the side though.
Firefox 3.5 beta is too open-this-in-a-new-window-happy when trying to drag around tabs. Wish I could turn that off; I never want new window
GoogleTechTalk's Web Exponents playlist is worth viewing if you haven't gone through them: 
@Tmtx Sleep was complicated by loud neighbors and being unfamiliar with the audio. I think I was more-awake waiting to see whether it worked
@cswingler Thanks. Just saw that too.
Queuing up a bunch of Google Tech Talks for background noise for the afternoon.
@svdodge Just realized the product page had this banner: "Instant Order Update.  You purchased this item on July 23, 2008. View this order."
I wish Amazon would remind me "You own this item" while I puzzle out where that book is on my shelves, or whether I'm just hallucinating.
@Eleuvox Thanks, looks like another useful tool to add to my growing collection. Going to recommend it to someone with an iPhone, too.
Sleep is going to be *interesting* tonight.
What network does Boost Mobile run on? Is that Sprint? Wishing they were a 3G carrier, at $50/month for unlimited everything including web.
@ashedryden That's generally part of being straightedge, actually. I'll introduce you to some screamo kids sometime.
@ashedryden I find it funny that you dose your cats. You're so sXe normally.
Powerbook is having a hell of a time downloading this Leopard update. My bandwidth isn't swamped, so it must be the Apple servers.
@littletinyfish Does it have a City of Milwaukee bike registration sticker?
"So I highly recommend you use === not ==" Douglas Crockford, JavaScript: The Good Parts Google Tech Talk.
zooomr proves to be fail, too. Frustrated at the simple failure of services to let me upload my stupid photos.
Changed my zooomr username, find #photocampmilwaukee photos at 
@SimplyPanera There's just no heat here & I want it to be a warm sunny springtime.
Flickr upload limit for free account was hit with just sunrise pictures from #PhotoCampMilwaukee. Uploading to Zooomr, infinite upload ftw.
@Narkalant Snow Crash ftw; finding enough parallels between the wearable tech around you and what's described in the book by Stephenson?
Camera should have accelerometer so that it knows when it moved, so that I know to retake. Also, preview zoomed section to judge blurriness.
@svdodge I still need to start using Shelfari. Thanks for the reminder.
@sixohsix I want to, but it is looking unlikely; haven't registered and the price keeps going up.
Where are the books that intersect between cognitive science and learning skills? Less interested books about study skills I already have.
For those behind the curve: I post links, quotes, and videos, tons of cool stuff relating to the web & the future, at 
@joshjs Coding chromosomes.
Went through and subscribed to every gReader bundle that looked interesting. Thousands of unread items now. Trusting gReader to keep me sane
@svdodge I found VLC handles the 2nd URL in the Windows Media link really well & is nice quality. Plus I can set it to reconnect if it dies.
@cthielen Try the open source utility irclog-xml. Defaults to outputting styled HTML.
I am Mercy for Animals: 
@svdodge I'm watching NASA TV, too! I was telling @ashedryden about how I had this channel on cable as a kid & it was awesome. *is* awesome.
And of course, Caribbean-style rice and beans would by my favorite not-quick no-labor meal.
Whole wheat fusilli with olive oil and red pepper flakes has to be my favorite quick no-labor meal. Toss with fresh chopped veggies ftw.
#fixreplies
Frustrated.
@littletinyfish I don't think I can ride that much, tbh.
Can't use boxee on Powerbook because it's PPC not Intel. Going to give compiling from source a quick try before #web414
@the404error You should check out  if you don't have plans for tonight ;)
Fast Rymdkraft track (bitpop like Slagsmalsklubben) was enough to push my reading speed at least 200wpm faster on similar text. Interesting.
@abraham What's shakin' in San Fran?
Trying to see if I can burn a playlist off a remote machine via shared iTunes. Copying over individual files will be a pain if I can't.
@gregtarnoff I'd love to compare notes sometime once I'm into it. And hack on jQuery.
@gregtarnoff That's on my to-read list. Once I get through current backlog of books.
i.e., a speedreading course book that spends 20 pages telling me the advantages of learning to read faster with personal stories of success.
Books that spend a chapter trying to 'sell' me on their ideas or methods are annoying. If I wasn't sold, I wouldn't have picked up the book.
Old Microsoft wireless mouse feels huge and clunky compared to the tiny, slick bluetooth wireless notebook mouse I've been using.
The cardboard box that my new helmet came in has a cool 'drawer' design. Trying to figure out what to use it for; how to decorate it.
@Narkalant Sounds like a party.
Flash pop-up targeted-marketing fail: "Fresh feminine hygiene in a convenient small package" from a Russian site. I don't think I need that.
This thunderstorm is neat.
@foop I'm interested in the Rails job, link to more info please?
#fixrepliesagain plz
So another change in Twitter replies is that I see @RyTron's & @heygabe's replies in my client's replies tab, but not in the regular stream.
@RyTron hey man leave my creative commons seahorses out of this.
It's a good thing everyone at @web414 uses #identica. because none of them saw that tweet & came over to me to vote on cutest seahorses.
Right. Apparently Tweetie DMs go to public now. AWESOME.
I need you to come vote on the cutest picture of babby seahorses. :P
Anyone have an Intel Mac running Leopard that I can test something on until about, say, June 15th?
At @web414. told not to twitter. not that anyone will see @-replies anymore.
If you need me, I'll be in my cave, banging two rocks together to start a fire. #twitterquit.
Nevermind, I give up.
Gah damnit, just got home, twitter has missed about 80% of the tweets I've been sending via txt. Yeah, none of this rant will make sense &gt;.&lt;
@streetzapizza Free pizza tonight (Friday the 15th) or tomorrow night, Saturday (the 16th)?
@twitter suggestion: When you ask us to confirm we want to block someone, give us an optional textarea where we can post a short reason why.
@cthielen Google search says an upside-down stamp is a prison code for "I love you."
@talktostrangers re:toe: was more an issue of cleaning up the blood first, then realizing it felt broken. only dislocated. injuries are fun!
The sad truth about losing a bunch of a weight, for guys, is that underneath there's no sexy Spartan warrior body, just a scrawny lanky joke
@heygabe That's a good book. I like that he mixes quantum physics speculation, scifi/fantasy, and a story about kids & cuttlefish :)
I just addressed/stamped an envelope upside-down. This snail mail thing is hard.
I think I broke my toe. Immediately my mind goes to how hard it is to build an X-ray machine to confirm, and how much fun it'd be to build.
@svdodge Try doing username++serviceTLD@gmail.com
@trodrigues Parts of that place look so fake and pretentious though. Would rather live in a modest home designed with epic window views.
@bucketworks btw if you have a box that runs Java & will be on during #web414, I can shoot you PieSpy and it can generate these every event.
@bucketworks Social graph of IRC for tonight was lonely: 
@heygabe can we talk about running another devhouse quickly at the end? Is that in the works?
RT @abraham: Sign up for @DrupalCampWI 
@jbdryden The Neverending Story is the reason we're on twitter right now, I think. Also the reason why we have massive collections of books.
My lost txts finally caught up with me. But I deleted them since they don't make any sense out of context of the rest.
But Twitter doesn't give me enough characters for that rant.
am are abducted by knitters
@raster Anything that wraps the libogg library. My personal favorite is sneetchalizer 
Listening to "Debugging and Testing the Web with Firebug" in the background, on the GoogleTechTalks channel while I do dishes.
@joshjs 
@3liza Well then, we'll factor in how well it burns for warmth as well when it goes out of style.
@drupalcampwi Update your site with an address for your location and more details instead of "We're still working out the exact details"
Why hasn't staindefender trickled down to my jeans and tshirts? Where's my stainproof, rain-shedding casual clothes that'll never wear out?
@cswingler Haven't lived in Racine/Kenosha for nearly a year now.
Seriously, designing a spray pump for Febreeze/Windex that actually works when its a little tilted has to be a million dollar idea.
@littletinyfish I need to talk to you about the Miller Lite ride, hope to see you at the Co-op tonight for tacos.
So the scratch on my finger that has been bothering me all day turns out to contain a huge sliver of wood. Didn't realize it until just now.
@raster It uses the USB Displaylink drivers, which they've released for Linux last time I checked.
The Circle of No Life 
@heygabe Taco Tuesday is every Tuesday. At the RW Co-op. EVERY TUESDAY.
#lazyweb: Articles on using Things.app effectively
@raster totally, except you have to remember they draw power only off USB, so it'd be a strain on the netbook battery.
The air was the smell of a PVC pool toy, sitting deflated and slowly melting in a warm garage.
@joshjs For me, it's become more like Charles Stross describing a character that "blogs his web throughput to a public annotation server;"
@gregtarnoff The Alterra on Prospect isn't very far away. Free wifi there and the same coffee.
@joshjs btw, you should join soup to keep up better, not put it in your feed reader. At least that's my thinking. Then friend me.
@Narkalant Robot awesomeness indeed.
Pumphouse Alterra 
@ashedryden made me do pro's/con's of flying cars earlier. Then I had to design a way to defeat Superman that was scientifically plausible.
@Bucketworks Have you seen this?  Thinking of all the cool places these could go: wikibots, doors, windows. Fun!
@joshjs All plans can be foiled. Hackers are clever.
@gregtarnoff It's too far away and I've got a big playlist queued up. Cleaning the stove now, fun fun.
@svdodge Nope, I dishwash/cook solo, mostly. Good thinking time.
Loud music while I make dinner. I'm surprised I haven't thought of laptop-in-kitchen before this. Makes sense for tunes and Youtubing.
Just knocked over a glass in the dark & spilled water on my desk. Luckily it was an isolated incident with no casualties.
"You're all about getting hurt and being macho about it lately. Like when you cut off your toe." -- @ashedryden
@svdodge Probably not.
@littletinyfish I'm planning to head to the bike co-op at 5:30. See you there.
@littletinyfish Track season starts tonight at 7PM in Kenosha. Dunno if I can use of my brother's car to get there, but thinking about it.
Learning to love Adagio's kukicha green tea. I have 2 sample tins they gave me for free, and it is caffeine. Still think it tastes like hay.
Aaaaaand the broccoli + mushrooms were definitely steaming too long; broccoli is dark instead of bright green. Hrm.
OK, I made too much food. Frying pan full of tofu, tomato, peppers, onion & garlic. Steaming broccoli, mushrooms in the ricecooker. Noodles.
Growing Power's broccoli is so good. Can't wait until I can get one of their produce boxes.
Stainless.app works pretty well on the Powerbook (PPC processor). Doesn't feel any faster than Firefox, but I haven't had it beachball yet.
@JoeSteve Yeah, I guess I look nothing like my avatar on here without the hair. Nice to meet you, too!
@offwhitemke Maybe it can show temp/forecast in the icon? Similar to Mail.app (on OSX) unread counts in the dock. But yeah, that'd rock.
@Teecycle_Tim Any idea if that's a free tour? When I was there, I remember it costing some small amount to take the tour.
Anyone have a scale (for standing on) that I could borrow for a few weeks?
1991 had some good music, man.
I find it kind of silly that I have to launch Safari to change my default web browser in OSX. When Safari was broken I chmod a-x'd it.
@jbdryden 15K tracks here.
Had a great time at the bike co-op tonight with @littletinyfish and @svdodge. Thanks for showing me the ropes, guys.
Just found out my rent is going up on June 1st if I don't move. Going up a lot. Gah.
@gregtarnoff There's just not a lot of cheap, calorically-dense vegan foods past eating lots of rice and beans, which I'm already doing.
@gregtarnoff Yeah but I'm getting throw-up sick from trying to make it to 2000 (I'm measuring everything;but maybe I'm not counting exactly)
I found quite a few resources on vegan athletes; they say eat lots, and certain things. 1800 calories a day is a lot with what I eat daily.
@gilesgoatboy My problem w/veganism currently is not enough muscle mass; finding it hard to eat the # of kcals they advise for athletes.
Wind coming in my (open) windows smells like cigarette smoke and laundry detergent. Ugh.
@svdodge Just got off the Oak Leaf. Missed you by &lt;5 minutes.
@gilesgoatboy Looking good. Feeling healthy?
Also mountain bike tire doesn't fit in my apt building's outside bike rack, and it's all quick release, so there's no way to lock it outside
Old mountain bike I bought for college is definitely on last legs. The front rim needs to be trued, but the spokes are all rusted. FUBAR'd
It has been years since I trained on the bike. So out of shape & my cadence+stroke are terrible (no clipless pedals) Need more training time
So freaking nice out, and I have to rest. Gah. Maybe a walk through the park later.
At the MKE Bike coop
Don't understand why some of the GReader bundles contain things like wiki recent changes feeds and CVS/SVN commit logs. They're just noise.
@ashedryden "SOYLENT HONEY IS MADE OF BEE BUTTS"
Aiming for 400-500 calorie surplus every day leading up to the UPAF Arts Ride. Remembering the dreaded 'bonk' from teenage mtn bike racing.
For those playing along at home, breakfast was 2 bananas, 2 cups(cooked) oatmeal w/cinnamon & 1/2 cup whole walnuts on the oatmeal. So full.
Relaxing for an hour or two before I head over to the bike co-op.
 looks to be a really good resource.
At the Palomino in Bay View
Eating a giant-ass fruit smoothie after an afternoon pedaling. Family is coming into town tonight and they insist we eat at a place I can't.
Gah, tonsils are swollen and its hard to swallow. Can *not* afford to be be sick right now.
That just took the wind out of my sails. Now filled with a bad feeling. Dread?
According to my Dad, there's an old Nike Missile silo site just north of Growing Power & McGovern park. It's Havenwood state park now.
Practicing macro mode shots at the mitchell domes
Can't afford the Macaframa DVD, but excited to get a copy. Rewatching MASH SF for the millionth time tonight. Love the soundtrack.
About to eat a whole pineapple.
@svdodge Whitefish Bay Library is hiring a Director
I should've been a librarian, yo.
Post-dinner sleepiness crash. I gots teh itis.
Oh, and smoothie has my new calorie-rich omega3/6 secret weapon: flaxseed oil.
Had a Phamous Philly at the RW Coop for dinner, but I'm hungry again so I'm making another huge smoothie w/soymilk, spinach, bananas, fruits
The unfortunate thing is, I don't think my resume would get any more interest in cities with more programming jobs than Milwaukee. le sigh.
Wondering if I can fake tiltshift some of these macro mode pictures of flowers / leaves to nicely blur out the background?
Nearly got runover on Oakland by a fullsize truck that ran a red light. Angry at guys who drive trucks right now.
@sixohsix I'm probably just going to use the rice cooker next time.
Also, I've been saying quinoa as 'quine' + 'noa' as in Noah. Apparently it's called 'keen-WAH'
Despite claims of quinoa's ease of cooking, I think I screwed it up. Looks nothing like what I'm seeing online.
@ashedryden re:octopus scarf. The tentacles have 240 suckers each on a real octopus. That's a lot. Knit knit knit?
Wishing I wasn't so out of shape.
Headset/quill came loose halfway home; steering cocked enough to annoy & hex tool at home. Made it home safe tho. Can't wait for new bike.
Heading out on the Oak Leaf.
Eating breakfast this morning would be so easy if I could just swallow without it hurting. Gah. Everything has to be extra-difficult.
@svdodge I know the antsy feeling. I've been like that on days I rest instead of ride, which always seem to have nicer weather.
Thinking I should have hit the rummage sales for curling bars and/or free weights this weekend. Oh well, too late.
Quite pleased with the new training schedule I came up with, it should put me right at being able to ride the UPAF Ride in time.
In case you didn't know, LEDs have black magic smoke in them, too. When you blow them up, the magic smoke comes out and makes you cough.
I was trying to prototype a simple LED front bike light with 2 LEDs & cardboard, and thought I'd use 5VDC wall wort to test. Blew them, oops
Walking over to Riverwest soon to meet @littletinyfish and head to the Bike Co-op. It's freezing in my apartment, would rather be outside.
*would've
Wish I had a camera with a bigger&brighter LCD. Wouldn't retaken the blurry macro mode shots if I knew they were blurry.
@JoeSteve Will do. Need to scour Craigslist for used rollers
Got some really nice macro mode shots at the Mitchell Domes of flowers and leaves. Can't post them on flickr until June 1st though, grr.
Making brown rice and quinoa. yum yum.
@offwhitemke Sorry, I just have a really complicated night schedule with various groups/volunteer stuff.
The UI for OpenSprints uses Shoes and Ruby, which I've played with in the past, even blogged about. Need to build the hardware first. #todo
Looking and OpenSprints  and wondering how much it could be simplified w/ old mouse wheel encoders & better software.
@offwhitemke Would like to go to Bootworks, but Wednesday is a busy night for me.
Telling @ashedryden we're a team, I'm the tank and she's the wizard to call in support from afar with her iPhone.
@talktostrangers Riverwest Coop does quinoa in their dishes & that's where I bought it, so I'm going to ask them how to cook it correctly.
The Thermals rock.
Designing a hipsack that'll fit my u-lock and go on my belt or alt on messenger bag strap. Planning to recycle old backpacks for materials.
@talktostrangers Rinsing off the bitter coating is apparently the important step, but one I over-did.
Wondering if a contact mic (piezo buzzer element) w/ an amplifier circuit can pick up heartbeat if pressed against the chest over the heart.
@joshjs &use SuperMemo-inspired algorithms to decide what to show, when. Decide time sensitivity w/GCal event parsing that gmail already has
@joshjs I'd be more interested in using Bayes classifiers to filter msgs other than spam, instead of static filtering. that'd be my email2.0
@joshjs @abraham My only problem, without seeing it demo'd yet, is that email today needs to be less noise, not more conversation(noise)
RT @OldManSmithers: I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids and your dumb dog! I'll get you for this!
I'll get whatever 11th grade kid did this to me!
@joshjs I've been avatar-vandalized!
rawr
@JoeSteve White Rabbits++. We should put together a mix CDR for the collective. I can burn it if you send some track recommendations.
Me: "Eat faster, mouth!" Mouth: "Shut it, I am sore from all your eating, fatty!"
@Narkalant I just figured there's a lot of muscle contraction & raised BP/heartrate when puking. You must be burning some measurable amount.
@Narkalant Inquiring minds want to know (mine & @littletinyfish's) how do you count calories when you puke? Do you burn any calories puking?
@jennaddenda The public art + robots pic is cute, indeed.
Ok. the new bike is marginally improved and safe enough to ride tomorrow. Sleepz awaits.
dinner at midnight: 1.5 whole wheat pitas and a cup of unsweetened raisins. Trying to spike the whole glucose level thing I've read about.
Err, presta valves. Doh. Tired.
Oh hey my cheap pump can be converted to work with Schrader valves, which my new tires have. Win!
Did I mention that this bad boy just happened to get 52x16 gearing with parts we had? Gonna be an intense ride tomorrow. Hills will be fun.
Brakes adjusted as best I can do, but they seem sketchy. Seat adjusted up and to right front/back distance. Now time to clean it.
New bike needs a lot of adjustments that I didn't see since we were hurrying out of the coop.
Home from the MKE bike coop with a new bike. Pics up on mathias.soup.io in a minute.
Lance Armstrong has become a shrewd businessman. Livestrong.com is full of ads; wants you to get filtering-waterbottles & his energy drink.
Ordered a Knog front light (the 5 LED model powered by 3 AAA's) from Amazon. free shipping ftw.
 Wish we had cool sidewalks in MKE. Esp if they lit up sections when you walked over & then faded. Pedestrian contrails!
Livestrong.com recommends Beef, Irradiated as a healthier alternative to a whole wheat pita. Riiiight.
@svdodge I can get up to speed on the flat. Maybe not 92 RPM (the Russian efficiency number) but soon. Strength training will help.
Surprisingly its my back muscles that will have to get stronger before my legs, not used to road bike position.
@littletinyfish @svdodge The bike cops were slow; I can't pedal this gear & stay upright that slow.Turned around & went back to the Oak Leaf
52t/16t isn't that bad, guys. (ps - my legs are dead after 18 miles)
Home.
Tried to uturn on the oak leaf & bought it. I'm ok, was slow. Luckily i have my hex tool with me today. Quills don't like me.
Riding with the City of Milwaukee bike cops down by the lake. No, really, all 30 or so of them are training today.
New bike is certifiably fast. Hills are 10x bigger though, & bumps are bigger on skinny tires too. Rain isn't good for my sketchy brakes tho
On first ride with new singlespeed Miyata bike.. Wish me luck!
Push-mower trailer for a bike. So want to DIY one of these. 
Red Delicious are my least favorite kind of apple. Unfortunately, that's what I got in my Growing Power Market Basket.
Also: frustrated by everything today. Hoping I can relax at the concert tonight.
Suspecting food poisoning from eating out last night. Been sick all day.
Trying Chromium beta for Mac, subrelease 17201 (latest build for today)
Also, on the @scottkwalker thing, having Facebook Connect and a twitter badge doesn't mean the site 'gets' new media & social networking.
@compujeramey for Governor. We'll build the site for free.
@scottkwalker's site design: bad. Could have done it in Drupal, in WI. Plenty of Drupal folks here. Way to put faith in WI's tech industry.
That bamboo frame is beautiful. 
Bamboo-frame triplet bike team riding across the US for world hunger: 
Hey, my Puma shoes aren't too wide/big to fit in my toeclips. Couldn't get the ball of my foot over the center of pedal w/usual shoes. Win.
@joshjs If they have reason to stop you on a bike, they can use this ordnance to give a moving violation ticket, which goes up to $350 in WI
And I think the wording of that ordnance means Shorewood police can't use it on City residents who might be, say, riding in a large group.
@littletinyfish So I was wrong, you have to live in Shorewood to need to register bike here.
@joshjs Yeah, the City of Milwaukee actually has a means to let you park overnight and has FREE bike licensing. Also, not as snobby.
Registration in Village of Shorewood is $10, valid for the life of the bike & can be done at the Village Hall, 3930 N Murray Ave Mon-Fri 8-5
4) Ord. 207-2: Unlawful for any person living in the Village to operate a bicycle on public roads unless bike is registered with the Village
3) While riding at night, bicycles must have a white light on and visible in the front, and a red reflector & visible on the back.
2) While on the roadway, cyclists must abide by all traffic rules: riding on right side, stopping at stop signs/lights & yielding to traffic
1 cont'd) unless the bike is equipped with a child seat AND carrying a child at that time.
Shorewood bike laws/ordnances according to Shorewood Pedestraian Safety Committee Brochure: 1) cyclists 12+ yrs old cannot ride on sidewalks
@rachelness Random question, how much do tandem bike rentals at the Urban Ecology Center cost?
Off to run errands on the bike now, in Shorewood.
All the play from my bottom bracket is gone. I'll pull the crank & properly tighten it at the coop on Sat, but for now this works!
Trying to tighten my bottom bracket with a rubber belt wrench. It seems to be working actually. (One of these:  )
The week of the UPAF ride is Bike to Work week. Free coffee, bakery, and repairs on Oak Leaf, at Ziedler Park & more! 
@svdodge Constantly. Especially while moving.
25 blocks to go
Off to run a few quick errands on the bike, then brunch at RW Coop, then riding to the MKE Bike Coop to work on my bike. Weather is amazing.
Just need to go to rummage sales to find a bike trailer, 2x training rollers, & old push mower, and all my plans will fall together nicely.
New Schwinn has registration/licenses for at least 5 cities on it, going back to 1969.
Bought a Schwinn Varsity paperboy bike, w/ fenders and baskets, for $5. Minimal surface rust, will made a nice coaster brake grocery-getter
@JoeSteve That sounds like the dick in a Dodge Ram fullsize truck who ran a red light, then gave *me* the finger for being in the road.
Slept in, heading over to the Shorewood Police bike auction to pick the bones, but guessing it's all done over theer.
I didnt know The Decemberists got so heavy
At the Riverside. First concert this year
Trying to down a whole bowl of oatmeal by drinking it, fast enough so that we can make it to the concert later. Yes, drink. Ugh.
I got junk in both my eyes. Had to stop at the Urban Ecology Center & flush them out with my water bottle
Made it to the bike coop awhile ago. Volunteering.
17th street. So many lights, so much cobblestone, and windy. In a slowmoving funeral procession right now. #bikeadventure
btw, @svdodge makes an excellent drafthorse (wind block) and pace-setter. Would've probably given up after 20miles if I hadn't followed Sam.
Also, I love my bike from the Milwaukee Bike Collective.
Hot shower was sooo good. Now that I've stopped, the exhaustion is hitting me. Going to take a relaxing stroll & go to the RW Art Walk later
50 miles! So exhausted. But fuck yeah!
Just passed @tapps at brown deer park.
At cedarburg coffee roastery. @svdodge &s I will hit 50mi today.
At brown deer park, having light lunch. Beautiful day for cycling.
Slurping oatmeal again to get out of the house in time for a bike ride with @svdodge.
Eating.
Depending on which twitter server in their cluster I'm apparently talking to, I may or may not have sent and received direct messages. weird
Anything cool happening in Milwaukee tonight?
Tripped and body checked a lamp post on the way home. Stiff. And now, a sore shoulder.
Just put in my 2 months notice to vacate my apt. Everything from here on out is uncertain & kind of scary.
Heh, you can see where my pedals started to wear into the soles of my shoes yesterday, also how thin tread is getting: 
No profile pic. It must be whatever ImageMagick-like system that Twitter uses for resizing profile pics is swamped, lately, & doesn't update
@svdodge This bike has a little curve going on:  Thought you'd enjoy it.
@talktostrangers This shows wheel truing, but not on a stand. Still, the best collection of tips I've seen on youtube: 
Uploading pictures from Mitchell Domes, learned my lesson, using flickr uploadr to resize the photos first, lest I use all my bandwidth.
Reading about how Schwinn made its frames on Sheldon Brown's site. Apparently the frame on my paperboy bike is bulletproof. Good to know.
iPhoto default behavior is not what I wanted. Grr.
@svdodge Probably not suited for long rides, no.
@svdodge Also, this awesome pursuit bike with unfortunate color scheme: 
@svdodge There's some crazy track bikes with the handlebars welded to the sides of the fork crown. Such as this: 
@svdodge Just wrap the stem in grip tape?
The future of the hipster handlebar-chopping frenzy:  I bet they could mount some old-people nubs & aerobars on that.
Next time outside, I'm wearing long sleeves. Gah, sunburn sucks.
I think my brother just found me a 700c wheelset with a flipflop hub, at the bike shop where he works. Hoping he did & it'll fit my bike.
Wondering what modern recordings of The Wailers would sound like. Some tracks sound so muted. But modern recording would overcompress it all
Growing Power is re-opening the Forest Home Cemetery greenhouses as another urban farm:  (JSOnline, via my dad)
Cruising maps.google.com in Terrain view for a nice set of rolling hills for tomorrow.
Watching every video I can find / reading all blog posts about truing bike wheels. My front rim has spokes that are looser than I realized.
@svdodge My training schedule says hill climbs tomorrow. Dunno if you'd be up for tackling that hill out past Port Washington Rd, in the AM.
@svdodge livestrong.com says that we each burned ~3906 kilocalories yesterday on the bike, not counting increased metabolism all day. Nice!
Then again, what I do know about how to behave at Jazz in the Park? I only have an education in Jazz. They probably had.. phys-ed degrees.
@offwhitemke I enjoyed Jazz in the Park when I went last summer. I didn't appreciate the crowd full of frat boys that talked on cellphones.
@offwhitemke Higher prices and the ability of a vendor to 'cut someone off' will possibly deter the drunks that @ashedryden mentioned.
@gregtarnoff I can't afford Whole Foods.
@offwhitemke I'll be happily attending Jazz in the Park, then. If they could somehow ban outdoor smoking, I'd give them all high-fives.
@ashedryden I'll get some Teese-cheese next time I'm at the RW Coop for you.
@littletinyfish I started using livestrong.com's daily plate because it was the first hit for nutritional data for anything I was looking up
livestrong.com won't let me add data for more than a day ago. I didn't update it yesterday. So it thinks I only ate an apple on Saturday &gt;.&lt;
Arms got sunburned badly yesterday, neck and face are fine. Legs don't hurt, that's a good sign.
Feeling really full right now.
@joshjs Considering I notice about once every 4 months, your ego stroking/crushing isn't working.
Now just to get the other 800 calories of this meal perfect.
Steaming asparagus came out perfect. yay!
I'm losing followers. Good for them. Don't know why so many people would care what I say, they're mostly getting noise if they don't know me
#todo: learn to do portrait photography, possibly take up yoga so that I can still bend my joints by the time I'm ready for a Century.
Waiting for @littletinyfish to tell me to stop breaking my bike. Also I should probably stop riding like a xcross rider on the cobblestone.
@JoeSteve alternative @-reply: Sure, but can it do bar spins?
@JoeSteve That bike can only end in sadness when the owner scratches it the first time & loses $hundreds in value. On any of those parts.
Rode to Alterra to hang out with @smutandeggs; back home in Shorehood now. Doing dishes in apron and yellow gloves.Classy, that's what I am.
@Eleuvox That's one way to do it. I can't say my front wheel truing is any less violent.
@ashedryden Ubiquity may or may not be making things slower. I haven't bothered to get Ubiquity going since I switched to the 3.5betas.
@smutandeggs Where are you headed for internets?
Kind of frustrated with things right now. Feels like I'm being sabotaged.
@JoeSteve It could be the nasty old chain that did it.
@blissdev @gregtarnoff Google &gt; than their evasion. They have a sales spiel for me, according to 800notes.com so I'm not calling back.
@JoeSteve don't worry it is fine, just louder now.
Why do I /not/ feel the need to return a call to an 800 number when the voicemail only identifies the caller as 'Jeff,' not the company ?
Snapped the tip off a tooth on the chainring @JoeSteve put on my bike on Saturday. Grinding noises now. Guess lighter weight=weaker
@DrNautilus I regret nothing!
@ashedryden As long as I get the profits. It'll make moving easier with less stuff and more money in my pocket.
OH: ""there is a huge platypus in my fridge"
Check out Millenium Park's awesome bike commuter parking & bike repair facility: 
@svdodge & I had to weave through a tight flock of Segways stopped on the Oak Leaf; wanted to shout "Get off the trail if you're stopped!"
Chicago does bike tours in Millenium Park. Why do we have people riding around the lakeshore on Segways & stopping to clog the Oak Leaf? Grr
Anyone have an old (intel) macmini they want to sell?
I have a twitter avatar again! I am a man not a number!
Slow getting going, but hoping for a productive training ride this morning. Sunburn is gone; that's good. Read it takes 3mos to really heal.
'Was' being the operative word there.
I turn on the light and spot silverfish scurrying for cover. Can't I live anywhere without bugs? This was the nicest apt I've lived in, too.
Messing with the bike, checking things for tightness before riding on it tomorrow. Safety first!
Wishing the twitter-fairy would grant me an avatar again.
@smutandeggs Sorry, I don't think I can limp over to RW in my sorry state tonight.
Well, those deep-v's inspired me. If I ever paint a bike, its getting a bland daytime color, glow in the dark at night & blacklight details.
Also, this is one very confused bike: 
glow in the dark deep v's? Yes please. 
@BlatzLiquor2 Most of them do now.
@ashedryden Please don't forget your bike on the bus rack. You'd never get it back.
@svdodge @ashedryden You just pop it and lock it.
@JoeSteve Yeah, I can only imagine pursuit bikes aren't that comfortable or fun to ride. They look mean, though.
@JoeSteve Yamaguchi Kilo Pursuit track bike on Flickr 
They're hiring Bike Taxi (pedicab) drivers for Downtown Milwaukee? I'm intrigued.
@JoeSteve 
Ths pic proves my point from ~1.5 years ago that fixie bikes are the BMX bikes of our youth, adult-sized. 
@gregtarnoff Throw a heat map overlay for relative crime density of the neighborhood, if such data was available, and I'd be delighted.
@gregtarnoff A web app that kept a DB of bike rack locs & overlay that onto GMaps would be easy, but keeping the data accurate would be hard
@gregtarnoff I think it'd be neat if there was a Javascript 'plugin' architecture for mobile Gmaps, but they'd never allow that.
It smells like socks in here. Ew.
@littletinyfish Well, I wasn't hoping for full Merino wool jerseys, but having a cheap lycra shirt to ride in would've been nice. Oh well.
@svdodge I'd do it on Saturday, but I want to wash my tshirt/bib (still unsure if we're getting actual cycling jerseys or a T-shirt)
Can't wait for the day I can use Google Streetview on my phone to see where I'm going and whether there's bike racks, before I leave.
Anyone know if there's bike racks for locking to near the Marcus Center? I need to ride downtown and get my UPAF stuff.
@svdodge I'm in for lots of #tweetrides this summer.
Raisins are still my favorite undead fruit.
I'm feeling slow today.
Anyone w/keys headed to the bike collective? We have customers and door is locked
6pm but theyre open every day. They gave us ours tho.
Rather, the car dealerships that are likely closing due to the economy.We already have places like the fitness center next to Classic Slice.
Bike Hugger blog had the great idea of turning old car dealerships into fitness centers with lots of bike parking. Sounds like a great idea.
@svdodge How's this for a bike with curves? 
For those wondering what I'm on about, I find it highly insulting that in MKE your opinion is invalid if you choose a sober lifestyle.
Reminder cont'd: Also, I hear the angry drunk people won't be there, or something.
Reminder: Jazz in the Park start tonight; get some culture.Spread the msg that we're not terribly concerned with whether we can drink or not
@svdodge They might have other areas or whole parks in more dire need of cleanup. The Oak Leaf is very well-kept.
We should plan a trail cleanup #tweetride for this summer too. Someone more-connected than me can talk to the City Parks dept about that?
@littletinyfish A slightly different kind of Bike Prons: 
@svdodge Since I'm getting kicked out of my apartment at 5PM by the apt managers, I guess I'm going for a late ride for a good 2 hours.
@smutandeggs @ashedryden Hold on, I'll go get the HUMVEE, and we'll find out.
Man, I want to get my Schwinn paperboy bike tuned up and go on a slow #TweetRide. Beautiful outside & I'm stuck inside cleaning not riding.
Cycling picture-blog of the day: 
@ashedryden I present: The Jury track frame to counter your Judgeness:  There's a better pun to be made here but I'm lazy
I love Kari from Mythbusters. Who else would shoot a minigun mounted on a HUMVEE in a sundress and combat boots? 
@svdodge &lt;playground-voice&gt; Your face sounds like other words! &lt;/playgrnd&gt;
OK I'm done with that for today. Pushed it too far.
@ashedryden I Cinnelli think this conversation is Schwinn Paramount to you, and not Motobecane of a lady. I mean Raleigh, Trek it from me.
This is srsly the busiest wknd ever. Going to miss 3 events, incl. watching bike polo, just to do the other 4 things I planned on months ago
@ashedryden They're really really cheap. I think I got 4 small sauce tomatos for less than $2. Maybe we can go tonight?
@pfhawkins They've been excellent apt managers & the best company I've rented from, though.
I'm tempted to leave a mess & come in angry @ 5PM (when they're showing it) saying I never got a note; they slid it under door at 11AM today
Bldg managers just gave me 6 hours notice (not 24 hours) that they'll be showing out my apt tonight. Cleaning instead of riding today. Grr.
@talktostrangers @littletinyfish Some sources are saying he hung himself. :/
@svdodge Oh Raleigh?
Can anyone tailor a pair of lame baggy cargo pants into skinny bike knickers? I'd totally pay for that. #tiredofworkpantsfallingdown.
Another night coming home late from the Bike Coop with dirty hands. Love it!
Zombie mode.
I think the phrase of the day might be "Code scares me but this is easy!"
Should've done MAMP from the beginning. My old school linux admin days told me I would have no trouble getting Apache2 & MySQL5 configured.
OH @raster: "It's about cowboys! And dinosaurs!"
@heygabe & I are using bonjour to browse the HDDs of people here who didn't lock down their sharing.
Watching Boondock Saints over the wifi from someone's shared movies folder
My kingdom for a Macbook that can get on the wifi :/
If I can't be drupaling on the internets, i'm gonna be star wars-ing.
Anyone have drupal6 on a flash drive at @drupalcampmadison? See me plz.
I just attempted to assassinate @raster in the car & wounded his pride. #spymaster.
@heygabe I hope your ride is a sleepmobile. Tiiiired.
I've been up for an hour and a half, running on empty energy but somehow moving. Trying to shuffle a sleepy girl towards Madison.
It's gonna be the longest weekend ever at this rate.
Made Tomato Basil pasta with fresh @growingpower tomatoes. So tasty! (and a huge veggie salad on the side)
The Palomino's seitan totally fooled me. Looks exactly like real steak, incl that fatty bit on the side. the waitress assured me its seitan.
Having seitan & tofu breakfast @ the palomino in bay view to get some protein&fat before UPAF +offset all the carbs(bagels) i've been eating
I made the session grid for @WriteCampMilwaukee all colorful (based on the post-it notes) in Google Docs, @ashedryden embedded it in drupal.
Long weekend isn't so bad, so far.
I hate when flash video is laggy. When is that? Oh right, constantly!
Wondering if I have anything I can improvise as a front bike light. Don't own any flashlights, not since I got cellphones.
My allergies are so bad today. I was a crabby camper at DrupalCampWI because of the misery.
Sorry that I tapped out so early in the UPAF ride. @svdodge @littletinyfish @joesteve we should #tweetride to Port Washingtn after I recover
@JoeSteve I reserve the award for first to get huirt on the UPAF ride.
@fragmad No.
Yay for morphine. Makes dislocated shoulders pop right back in!
2nd ER visit today. took all the king's horses & all the king's men to put  @mathiasx back together again.
Dear Twitter: I fell off my bike. UPAF ride's over for me :/
Getting ready to leave for the UPAF ride. It's early, I'm freezing cold becuase my apartment is 40 degrees, and I'm too tired to care.
I've determined Bob Dylan's Hurricane is my new favorite song. (not new to me, we listened to Dylan's catalog on repeat in the newsroom)
Jeans are the only reason I don't have to repeat this cleaning step on my knees. If I'd been smart & bought gloves, I'd be a lot less cut up
Changing bandages on my hand is a lot more gore than I'd hoped for & involves a third party scrubbing gravel our of the wounds with soap.
The promise of digital records hasn't come; I still have to go back to Columbia St Mary's for X-Rays & records.
@gregtarnoff With the required downtime you'd never make that much beore another iPhone model came out.
@blissdev no worries
@cheshster Palm Pre?
@svdodge that's the Steve Jobs plan for economic recovery! now everyone has to go get jobs to be able to buy one! no more funemployed.
the iPhone is every geek's dream of a cyberdeck, tricorder, hitchhiker's guide, illustrated primer & handheld computer rolled up into one.
They've certainly been listening to iPhone user gripes.
I keep forgetting I have a useless arm velcro'd in place that hurts to move. You'd be surprised how many movements require your shoulders.
Apple is only talking about laptops so far & they've blown my mind already.
RT @JoeSteve: Word of advice, kids. Don't try and jump out of a car going 24mph. Or fall off a bike at that speed, for that matter.
@svdodge #WWDC F5/CMD-R party? except i think i'll be offline the entire afternoon.
This arm-immobilizer is impossible to adjust yourself, compared to the simple arm sling. And there's no one here to tighten it for me.
Thinking about signing up to volunteer at the Riverwest 24. Don't know if I'll be recovered to train & then ride in it by then.
RT @CityofMilwaukee: Morning Milwaukee! Bike to Work Week starts now! Pump your tires, grease your chain and sign up! 
Inspiration for all my biking friends   especially those of us that crashed today.
My mom says I'm all banged up now to match my bike, which has a lot of scuffs and scrapes
@talktostrangers @JoeSteve I'm just glad no one pulled a Lance & broke their collarbone. Or bounced their head off the pavement.
@satellitecrepes See you tomorrow at Zeidler Square!
My brother doesn't realize how nice this place was. Thinking I should schedule to see some really nastt]y apartments to scare him.
Looked at an apartment in Riverwest that was really nice, but it had a really steep price to go with it. Don't think I could ever afford it.
Need RW Coop tacos & my shoulder to stop aching.
@joshjs My shoulder popped out backwards, not forwards (which is more common) not my bum, heh. sorry. should've clarified.
@retrotrash Soft tissues must heal slower than bones.
Doctor said no biking for 6-8 months, likely. Surgery is still likely. Had a rare posterior dislocation, not anterior, more damage to tissue
I get to have Miles Davis in the MRI. Awesome.
It sucks to be useless and broken.
I've been feeling much better since I stopped the painkillers they prescribed me & started taking plain Tylenol.
Despite some pain, today and yesterday were full of awesomeness.
My brother keeps fielding calls for a 70's Camaro he has for sale. It is interesting to hear him break down all the things wrong w/that car.
Apparently my apt bldg has a bed bugs infestation. If inspection finds them, it is up to the renter/renter's insurance to cover the treatmnt
We missed @satellitecrepes because my family got tied up in Racine. oh well, next time.
(I'm using a macmini with a keyboard+mouse, not a laptop with a touchpad)
Apple iPhoto selection/focus issues are making me swear. Dear Steve Jobs: One mouse btn yay, but CMD-click is impossible with only one hand?
In a terrible twist of fate, my robotic arms have overpowered me & made me into a mad scientist super villain! why didn't I see this coming?
I'm going to build myself an 8-armed robotic prosthesis; this can only go well.
@heygabe  it's totally not about Bill Paxton, no.
@littletinyfish Or "polygamists among us: what you need to know to keep your family safe" on the nightly news. They thrive on muckraking.
Hey, I've got nothing to do today but smile. Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da here I am The only living boy in New York [Milwaukee]
Listening to the BBC Radio Documentary "The Bicycle Diaries" 
Up in the middle of the night eating oatmeal, so that I can take my painkillers without nausea. It is hard to sleep when you're seasick.
Sorry that I'm not at the MKE Bike Coop tonight @littletinyfish @talktostrangers & @JoeSteve. Didn't have a ride & I'm useless right now.
At the place where i crashed in fox point where i crashed my bike.
@Teecycle_Tim $30 or $40 for a helmet is a small price to pay compared to hospital bills & brain damage for life.
@Teecycle_Tim I have to say, I'm lucky not to have more injuries from my crash during the UPAF ride due to wearing my helmet.
&lt;10mins & my grandparents are complaining about everything on the menu. Not enough meat here; they want to know if we can go to Cousins. Hah
@littletinyfish just saw you riding past beans&barley on north
I think Beans&barley exists as a compromise for all the young eastsiders (in their 20s mainly) & their families that don't eat adventurously
I just told my grandparents "This is our decision, to live fast and die young" re:my bike crash, quoting MGMT ;)
@rachelness Link to related news articles?
@raster I'll be there.
Ladies & Gentlemen, my brother and I have secured a flat in Riverwest.
helps/helped
@svdodge we'll see once i do some physical therapy. no range of motion or strength in my shoulder. luckily strength training for UPAF helps
@svdodge Yeah no bikes or trainers. The body uses the knees&shoulders as shock absorbers on the bike; my shoulder has no physical stop there
No surgery in the immediate future. My doctor is amazing at what he does; I'd trust him from what he's said so far to operate on me.
I refuse to be a part of this whole #squarespace circus even though I really need an iPhone.
Back to another round of Doctors today. Going to find out whether I'll need surgery.
Can someone come turn this yam I have into Cafe Hollander-style sweet potato frites? I can't bake by myself &gt;.&lt;
@Arlen No chance I can convince you to enable full text feeds on  , is there?
But I've found that one still has to manually delete Keychain entry for each encrypted wifi network & tell it to allow configd when prompted
A temporary fix may be to symlink to the configd binary (hidden to most users in OSX's file chooser) & add that to the Firewall allowed list
The 2 choices for wifi is either to set a manual IP, & change settings every time you're on a different network, or turn off 10.5's firewall
For the uninitiated, 10.4's Firewall allowed you to block certain ports, either TCP or UDP. 10.5 attempts to block/allow certain executables
From the forum threads I've read, Apple doesn't seem to know whether this is a Keychain corruption or ipfw rule issue, or both. Troubling.
Leopard firewall on my Powerbook is denying configd from receiving DHCP assigns again. Highly annoying that there's no simple, permanent fix
This #twitpocalypse brought to you by #squarespace.
Made Madras curry fried tofu to eat on a sandwich using @ashedryden's patented "shake n fake" ziploc method.
@Arlen The 'Welcome to Safari 4' page plays a noise while the Safari icon is displayed, on tiger & leopard
@Arlen  The noise is a little unexpected & annoying for a browser launch.
@Arlen I haven't used Safari enough for it to have history, so it picked sites like Expedian & Yahoo.com.
Last night's @web414 session on HTML5 was a real inspiration. Thanks @Arlen!
@raster I'll be a lefty handed mouser & probably type 90wpm with just my left hand before I'm healed & able to use both hands again.
Things I never thought I'd have to relearn how to do: take a shower, put on tshirt/pants/belt, tie shoes. Pretty much everything physical :/
Anyone need an OSS geek w/exp in coding (Ruby, Java, you name it) to do helpdesk/support, server admin and/or technical writing? I'm looking
@littletinyfish Brakes are good.
@JoeSteve I used to live a couple blocks from that place in Kenosha.
My mom talked my brother out of moving to Rierwest now, going to miss out on a really nice apartment.
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
This is a test of the #squarespace emergency broadcast system. Had this been a real emergency, instructions on iPhone winning would follow.
@raster got me a quinoa (KEENWAAAAH) candy bar yay
There's furries here & @ashedryden is all excited
I hate red delicious apples but my market basket was full of them. nom nom.
Everything is harder w/1 hand, out of painkillers & my landlord wants apt clean & me gone for 4 hrs this afternoon to show it. So frustrated
Aw damn, Flash doesn't have an undo button. #kulerfail
Starting a Zen subtheme on #drupal using the Zenophile module. Hoping I'm doing @ashedryden, @blakehall & all the Wisconsin Drupalers proud.
The smell of someone cooking on a grill is coming in my open windows & it smells really #squarespace -lickin' good.
iPhone users: What does Mobile Safari do when it encounters a file upload form, considering there is no FS access. Can you pick from photos?
@raster sorry that i couldn't help scare her into wearing one.
Anyone have a Yahoo Pipe to turn a Youtube user's feed of new video into a feed with the videos embedded?
@JoeSteve How's Kenosha? Beautiful weather for track season I imagine.
And before anyone suggests I eat out or go to the grocery store, I'm too broke for that.
Too worn out & sore to cook, but I've only got raw ingredients that don't add up to a meal. Grumble.
I miss my bike, Bob. 
@joshjs re:Locust Street: As I found out yesterday at the Summerfest grounds: crowds, some ppl drunk, & my shoulder being injured do not mix
@joshjs I think I passed your Ruckus while walking to Stone Creek for coffee
Twitter is so boring today. When did you all get lives, much less, private lives?
don't know where to go in shorewood for 4 hours. can't stay home, in pain. grr.
I tied my own damn shoes. A major accomplishment.
Wishing I could bike to Fuel. Planning to try to be in Riverwest in the next hour.
Anyone want to get dinner at 6? I've gotta be out of my apartment until 8 & have nothing to do. Would like to try a place I haven't been to.
Showered, shaved & bandaged. Ready to take on, err, the rest of my day. Not that I have anything planned.
I find it funny that my mom is better at #squarespace than I am.
@Arlen Headline-only & partial feeds are like sending an email with only a URL in the body, asking me to leave my email client to read it.
@Arlen That's a valid concern as a blogger, especially when you're creating technical content, not "what I did with my day" livejournaling.
@joshjs @ashedryden that's why I've worked my explanation about public/private key crypto into a One Thousand & One Nights-style explanation
Everyone who has a soup.io should tell me now, or forever hold your peace. I just found @tapp's soup in soup.io/everyone
unseen shoulder injury, that is. like, you can't tell it is hurt, except for my wearing the immobilizer.
It will take awhile for the wounds on my hand to heal, and there will be a lot of scarring. Even longer for my unseen shoulder to heal, tho
My mom joined twitter so she can #squarespace.
@gregtarnoff Then I'll give the #squarespace iPhone to my mom & use the bigger Apple store gift certificate from @iphoneblog for myself.
So if I @iphoneblog with the URL  I might win an iPhone 3GS gift certificate? I'll take my chances with #squarespace
@gregtarnoff Brown rice doesn't take 45 minutes in my cooker. The quinoa was still al dente. I didn't time it, but I'd say 20 mins cook time
As far as I can tell, Clay Shirky's job is to be amazed whenever people collaborate online, and then go give a presentation on it.
So, you can totally cook rice & quinoa in the rice cooker together. You just have to watch the rice for done-ness & shut off the cooker.
Saw @joshjs on my way to Fuel in Riverwest today, and saw @talktostrangers on my way home. Hung out with @blissdev & @littletinyfish in RW.
@blissdev was trying to think of games I can play one handed. We agreed I should get a Wii.
Gah, the vibe motor in my phone just died, so I havent been seeing new txts or getting calls. Needs some #squarespace
Seen in Fuel's mens bathroom: "i'm a fan of iran" right by the "sexytime train" graffiti
I just added a magazine to my long-dead Politics folder in GReader. Feel like I'm going to regret it and unsubscribe in a week or two.
Gah. Shoulder, curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal.
@Arlen I wouldn't mind a Washburn to downtown Bayfield light rail service. Love camping up there. The ferries are awesome.
Have I mentioned how much I loved BLDG BLOG? Really, I do. 
For the first time in about 2 years, I stared at a signup screen and debated coming up with a new username. But I'm still @mathiasx. huzzah.
With all the RTs, twitpics, blip's, and #iranelection tweets, beginning to look like spam in here.Not that I'm complaining, just interesting
Doing physical therapy exercises. It is shocking how much strength you can lose and the amount of stiffness from not using an arm for 1.5wks
Have you ever really wondered how many tostaditas #squarespace you could eat in one sitting? I just found out it's about 1/2 a bag for me.
@ashedryden automatically assumes I've never heard of any of the music she listens to. I'm out of touch.
Having a sentimental geek girlfriend, in a nutshell: she'll hack your computer & leave little cute things scattered all over your HDD.
In the words of Jonathon Coulton, I feel fantastic.
Worked hard in Physical Therapy today and got compliments on my lifting form. Chocolate protein smoothies all around!
Dear every bootstrapped startup in the last 5 years: Stop sending me 'newsletter' emails. Write a blog post. I'm looking at you, 37signals.
squatting my facebook username / vanity URL. still don't want to use facebook for anything, ever. no, I won't friend you.
The glass part of my french press has been broken for awhile. Today, I took the plunger part and used a cup to make a soy milk frother.
@raster Finally got OSX running on the eeePC?
@ashedryden I trademarked the hurt shoulder bit. He's dissolving my personal brand.
Need to #squarespace before I do anything else today. More physical therapy and my apartment being shown. I lead such an exciting life.
The image compression on book covers on Amazon.com is all kinds of terrible. Especially on simple OReilly technical book covers. What gives?
The apartment management company is really aggressively trying to rent my place. They've shown it every day since Thurs, now. Twice tomorrow
@retrotrash My road rash healed a lot quicker than I thought it would, for how bad it was. Shoulder, not so much.
Tired and feeling gross from being under hot lighting fixtures. That was more than a little stressful.
Just nearly witnessed an accident. A little girl (4 or 5?) ran out onto busy Oakland Ave ahead of her mother, into oncoming traffic.
@corbenfrost You can get poisoned. They mix ethanol with isopropyl alcohol.
@corbenfrost Wrong kind of alcohol, corben. Nice try though.
@Eleuvox Ouch. That sucks. Now you have a story to tell, though.
Engadget's long reviews of products like the iPhone, new Macbook Pros, and Kindles, have become my favorite source. Always was a fan, tho.
@DrNautilus Potential Band Name: Gypsy Pole.
@svdodge Actually cream (for Milwaukee) background with shades of green (for the environment) and brown. In my head it worked, in reality no
@littletinyfish Yeah, I'm kind of stalled on it, but the Drupal install is running on my laptop. Didn't really like the color combos I tried
Let my vote for #lyt today be cast: #sinman the DIN man.
I can't find yesterday's motivation to do physical therapy exercises. Taking a coffee break and reading. #squarespace.
#macports Well, there's your problem right there: " -arch ppc -arch i386" Gah.
#macports The linker keeps thinking I'm on x86, but this is a PowerPC machine. Anyone know how to correct it? I'm not calling it directly.
Fighting off headaches with Alterra's extremely good special espresso roast (this week only)
Now I'm gonna be on Google street view in my white immobilizer, outside the apartment bldg I'm moving out of.
Just got passed by the Google Street View car on Oakland ave. White SUV for anyone else in MKE. Camera dome, GPS dome & assumed wifi antenna
@svdodge And I'll just mount a talking GPS on the headset, bar-less ftw.
I can't forget that I still need a 3GS from #squarespace to call my own. #phonelust
@svdodge My next bike is just getting BMX grips on the top tube. Like that time we were riding back from Cedarburg and I was stretching.
Delightful new music discovery: 
@JoeSteve @svdodge Oh no, it's happening. Bars are mutating from some alien virus infection:  (via Bike Snob NYC)
@raster The problem is that aggregators/Planet*-type sites change the GUID. It's not my feeds I'm worried about, it is about using others'.
@ashedryden got an iPhone 3GS last night and now I can't stop wanting one myself. The new Macbook Airs & Pros were disappointing though.
@raster If the domain changes (say, Planet Lisp reposts it), then I'll still have two posts in two feeds that are identical.
Ugh, there's a lot of easy ways to uglify a site with the right shades of cream and brown.
It's time to #squarespace while I #drupal at Alterra. @ashedryden and @littletinyfish present.
@littletinyfish just made it to alterra. Later, crepes on center str.
Overheating. So this AC thing apparently is required, even in Milwaukee.
@ckittel Maybe it's the Microsoft Bing SUV. Of course, Google has hybrid Priuses, so Microsoft would use a V8-powered SUV. Makes sense.
If recovery for my shoulder is constantly accidentally hurting it, I'm doing swimmingly. Second day in a row I've felt I've torn something.
I need to #squarespace.
@jennaddenda I vote Ghostbusters-style fire pole. Actually, I want to build the old firehouse from Ghostbusters, as authentic as possible.
@fragmad @corbenfrost I've always disliked the way Apache is configured, and it has little to do with running on Linux or POSIX config files
@raster Pitched roof on rollers. Take it with them when they leave, not a permanent installation. Call it 'art'
Wow, today was awesome.
We missed the crepe guy this afternoon. Having Ethiopian Cottage for dinner though, excited.
My dad brought me a window AC unit, a moleskine & an empty bag of Alterra Blue Heeler for me to refill.
At Mai Thai on Brady Str.
@IronRinn Did you say #squarespace ?
@petdance Thanks. I haven't done reviews before, but I'll try. I need to redo my resume & get some interviews, so I'm excited for this book.
@littletinyfish My Schwinn pump is failing.
I'm on Goodreads now. Feel free to add me. 
@raster Better question, why are *you* using it?
Just ordered @petdance's new book and Infinite Jest from Amazon. Now, time to relax until family shows up.
Overheating in my 3rd floor apartment, but it has been beautiful outside all morning. Debating a run, which would be against doctor's orders
My day started around 5AM. Thought I'd get an early start on everything, but I don't think it is gonna last.
@littletinyfish Penguins don't live in Milwaukee. Just in Linux servers.
@JoeSteve Ouch, dude. Here's to fast healing. Sidenote: We may need to start an injury club or something. Or a wheelchair rugby league.
I think they've shown my apartment to 6 people today. Half an hour and they'll leave me alone (I keep getting kicked out) Making a smoothie.
My Trek mountain bike provided the cap for the skewer, that fits the fluid trainer, that lets @mathiasx ride his bike against Dr's orders.
I need a skewer for my rear wheel that fits a CyclOps fluid trainer, then, I can ride (indoors) again.
Shorewood Library, Transfer Pizza for dinner, then possibly stopping at the MKE Bike Coop to say hi; still can't work.
Apartments today were all bust. The place that my brother backed out of is rented; can't go back to looking at that. More appts tomorrow.
@Arlen do you have a page of links for HTML 5 demos? Tried to find some of the stuff you had shown; I know some of them you had written.
It's 4:04. Watching the June Web414 show with my dad.
Hiked to the dam on the river in Estabrook parK. Too masny adventures in the heat for one day, my dad says.
@JoeSteve Those dropouts on the first link are awesome.
Breakfast is my own attempt at Thai iced coffee.
Wow, it's been a real parade of sirens on Oakland tonight, over the last few hours. Fire and police? Wonder what's going on.
At Casablanca. Family in town + the heat means we've been eating out a lot. Especially places with AC.
Just put down a security deposit on a place in Riverwest.
There's a woman behind me on a Macbook Pro at the Shorewood Library working on an Arduino sketch. Cool!
Had brunch at Hotch-a-Do. Vegan burrito was really good.
@raster He didn't get any of @heygabe's jokes. Perhaps gave him the wrong impression of what #web414 is about? No offense to either of you.
OH SNAP
"Ow, that's so funny it hurt my shoulder." - me.
Sticker idea: "I Closed Wolski's" sticker, but "I broke Twitter" on it. I need one for my laptop. Or @twitter can hand them out selectively.
@Tmtx Relapse after my stint in the ER. Caffeine helps. Some days.
One piece of mail dictates the next couple years of my life.
Folding things to fit in envelopes is a skill I never learned in school. I think I can blame the public educational system for that.
Wishing I could leisurely bike over to RW in the shade of the Oak Leaf, but I'll have to walk. Alterra in a 1/2 hr, need AC and iced coffee.
@littletinyfish @svdodge @JoeSteve Dude has buckteeth. Totally not me.
Woke up, at my now-usual 5AM time slot. Poking at words for something I was supposed to submit last night.
@joshjs That's a hazard of Shorewood apartments. Look forward to its 4000 offspring getting their revenge on you, now.
@cswingler Casablanca Milwaukee.
Why did the UWCreditUnion send me, an existing member, email about a sweepstakes for new customers? Top prize: 13" MBP! 
Also, ran into @svdodge at Roast today in the afternoon. Forgot to tweet. Website designs were discussed and I had lots of iced coffee.
@ckittel The Enterprise is powered by an SGI O2, I bet.
@ckittel Hopefully they're not running Windows 3.11
iPod is on shuffle, blasting through the new pair of portable speakers, trying to find songs that distort at max volume. So far, not bad.
@svdodge Yeah, winning an iPhone from #squarespace for everyone in our little group would be nice.
Having a peach.
Red eye into a glass of ice. Yum. Also, downloading the latest diggnation, to cure my curiosity (haven't watched it in roughly a year)
@abraham That won't work so well.
Tired.
Overfull.
@smutandeggs You don't have to, necessarily. For one thing, my 1br super-nice apartment in Shorewood isn't rented yet.
I accidentally got @ashedryden addicted to World of Goo.
This bike is a paradox: Both vomit-inducing ugly and beautiful at the same time  
The reason I can't login to online banking with my bank? They disallow all user agent strings that are not Windows (Mac, Linux, etc)
Watching a lady hand-feed a raccoon.
Submitted something, now the nervous anticipation of a decision.
Sheet music parchment, folded up into heavy paper planes, blow around in the gutter, sprinkled with rain.
@talktostrangers I need to do that, too. Not that I ever drive a car. My address is 2+ years old on my license, though.
@gregtarnoff Not set in stone, yet. Still waiting to hear back on my application.
@raster @gregtarnoff I've got a moving date of Aug 1st, too. Hopefully won't need a moving truck for my stuff.
@joshjs @offwhitemke Welcome to the funemployment club? Seriously, though, sorry to hear. Hang in there.
@abraham Great Lake Swimmers.
Gah don't tell me we all have to tweet #moonfruit now. That's almost as bad as that polygon thing.
@Eleuvox Ouch dude. Take it easy? Sounds like you're trying to destroy your hands.
Just read the fine print and realized #moonfruit needs to be tweeted every day, instead of the 'once to enter' for #squarespace. Joy?
@offwhitemke Nice. I love my little Microsoft bluetooth notebook mouse.  Yours looks even more awesome.
I've been slaving over a hot crockpot all day to make vegan potato+yam soup. It's absolutely delicious.
@offwhitemke Walgreens has super cheap wired optical mice, if you're in a pinch.
RT @RyTron: Zombie Short Film fest in Toronto  Further proof that where I live is better than where you live. via @Guin
OH: "Yeah, we don't need Pirates of the Carribean monopoly."
Just passed @joshjs on oakland. He was scootering.
I'm so tired that the text is moving on my monitor like little waves, squirming around under my gaze.
Waiting to go eat, but we're in a waiting pattern until all parties are ready. So hungry for #moonfruit you have no idea.
It took a lot of convincing to get my parents to try Ethiopian food.
@joshjs Potential Band Name: [Verb] That [Noun]!
A lambda cloud just went by.
Waves of hungriness just swept over me.
I need brunch. Starving! #moonfruit.
Covered in hives, skin is red all over. Terrible allergy attack, and it comes when my allergist wanted me to stop antihistamines for a test.
Chalk that last tweet up to #thingsImnotsupposedtobedoing
I can hold myself in a push-up position without my shoulder hurting or fatiguing, but I don't dare try to do a full push-up yet.
Could really use some coffee, but I'm back home, on twitter, hitting refresh. Neither #moonfruit nor #squarespace to be had. Oh well.
#fortunecookie: "we all live under the same sky, but we don't see the same light."
Having kung pow tofu & a green tea mango bubble tea at the East Garden. Lunch menu is really reasonable & comes with soup + fried rice.
The air smells like shampoo chemicals. Also, the weather today is awesome.
When the moon hits your eye like a big #moonfruit pie that's amore.
I have VEGAN GLUTEN-FREE spaghetti from AUSTRALIA you all are so jealous I know
@joshjs Potential Band Name: Star Expansion.
It is freaky to get an envelope from yourself, written  in your handwriting. Until you realize it's a SASE full of Laughing Squid stickers.
Can't sleep so I'm watching an oldish episode of Diggnation I downloaded, mentioned in this tweet: 
The first 2000 of anything are the hardest. After that, it's all routine and downhill.
I think maybe Fuel Cafe is a little too punk rock for my dad.
I'm allergic to /everything/. Sneezing uncontrollably.
So I herd you liek #moonfruit.
@nic0 Potential Band Name: The Soggy Plinthers.
They came to show my apartment while I was still asleep in bed. That was awkward.
Awake, skin is itching like crazy. Need antihistamines stat.
This alterra has bike fed canvas bags & different tshirts. Also they've got the bialetti moka pot I want. Cool.
At the foundry alterra then down to humbolt park to relax.
4 more weeks of physical therapy to try and get some more range of motion and build strength back up. Then doctor will evaluate, again.
Just signed a lease on an apt in Riverwest.
Getting allergy tested.
Eating carrots and hummus for a mid-morning snack. Yeah, I'm weird.
Making smiley faces in the pour over coffee filter.
@raster Amazon!
@fragmad Coffee would be nice. I've got some new stuff to try this morning.
Listening to Wilco (The Album) on repeat, hoping it grows on me. Honestly, only two songs impress me.
2 more apartment showings scheduled tomorrow. I sign a lease on the new place tomorrow in between two intense Doctor's appointments. Fun fun
Getting groceries.
@raster Actually I like gears. The fixie-as-fashion thing is silly. @svdodge and I were joking about the Urban Outfitters fixie bike line.
Need 1000 coffee plz
"kids & their fixie bikes these days. back in my day we had 24 gears and we liked it. And we could pedal uphill, both ways!"
At Roast. Completely empty in here. Beautiful day outside in Milwaukee.
Going to listen to a guy busking on brady
Tonight at @web414: the Drupal apologist hour.
I guess I'll watch the high def version of Ghost in the Shell I've had sitting around. Anything else going on tonight in the MKE?
Saw a cool whiteboard idea: Just a big (4'+ wide) black picture frame for a painting, with no backing, on the wall. Draw on the glass.
Tip #5 addendum: Don't tamp the grounds. This isn't a real espresso machine.
That's about all the tips off the top of my head. Note that this isn't a real espresso machine nor a drip coffee machine, so advice differs.
Tip #6: Burr grinders are always better than blade grinders. Blenders will work in a pinch, but you will get a random grind coarseness.
Tip #5: If you've got a grinder, you can experiment with the grind. This isn't real espresso, you want a medium-fine, not superfine, grind.
Tip #4: Use a thermometer in the frothing pitcher. Work out your own temp preferences, but I do 120 degrees for milk & 100 degrees soy milk.
Tip #3: If you're going to steam milk or soymilk, chill the frothing pitcher beforehand in the freezer.
Tip #2: Preheat the heater coils with the pressure cap removed, and preheat the water in an electric kettle or stove top kettle.
Tip No 1: Never let steam/boiling water pass through the grounds. Too hot = bitter. Shut off pressure to the filter when it starts hissing.
Making coffee in the little fauxpresso (no pump/lever) machine. Thinking of tweeting a few tips on how to use these machines to the fullest.
Today is not the day to go out on the bike. Oh well.
Just passed @tapps
Vegan waffles plz.
Putting together a sort of queue so that I can read all of the new books from the Library in a finite time span.
I wonder where I could get a red tea bubbletea. Or if I could make my own. It sounds appealing.
@fragmad Is this where I wish I had an iPhone. I think it is. Desperately need an iPhone, in fact.
@cthielen RoR is pretty easy to get into. Adv Web Dev w/Rails should take a wknd, The Rails Way is a quick in depth read despite its bulk.
Cleaning out txts on my phone. Silly artificial 150 txt limit. It just complains but isn't smart enough to delete old txts itself.
@blissdev Congrats! Write a blog post about it after the 1st day? I imagine you'll have interesting opinions compared to most tech bloggers.
Thoroughly engrossed by the copy of the WIRED magazine style guide I found at MKE Central library.
Made a fried tempeh sandwich for lunch. It is very good.
Headache. Need coffee.
Hi, my name is @mathiasx and I'll be your server today. Would you like any Wingdings to get started?
More experiments with the fauxpresso machine: red tea shots. I've made these before. Thick and syrupy red tea awesomeness.
Going for a hike in the woods. In the middle of Milwaukee. I love our parks system.
It is ATTACK OF THE GIANT CATERPILLARS over here.
Heading to UWM to turn in more paperwork. hoping the dept i need is still open.
@RyTron The 3G/3GS battery isn't that bad. And I'm usually near a USB hub, during the day.
I really need an iPhone.  My old verizon cheapie is crashing every 5-10 keypresses/slider-closes, requiring a hard reset by battery removal.
So, utilities are my new place are going under hte budget billing plan. Which means they'll cost more now, but won't shock me in the winter.
Booting the Android LiveCD in qemu.
The Warren Commission has determined the nature of my bike accident: 
@littletinyfish We'd need to get some exercise bikes or trainers & machine pulleys+generator mounts for each. The inverters + batteries.
Vegan tacos at the RW Coop later.
@raster Get a sponsor to donate towards carbon credits to offset the electricity (estimated) used during BCMKE?
Maxed out shoulders with 30LB free weights  in physical therapy today. PT is progressing well, I'd say.
Debating what I can just throw away or give away on CL instead of moving. Too much stuff.
Always nice to know when I'm not wanted or needed.
Coffee time!
Seriously, I don't know why I'm up at 2:30AM. But I can't see sleeping any time soon. Too much to /do/
@offwhitemke Thanks, signed up. One thing you might want to consider is opening the bookmarklet 'save' page in a new window, soup.io-style.
@svdodge I'm in for Firefly marathon. Can we top it off with Serenity?
Lazyweb: Delicious-like bookmarking service, minus the social features, without the signup cost of pinboard.in ?
@TeecycleTim There's more than one copy in the Library's inventory, so I may end up with a different book, possibly sooner than later.
@TeecycleTim Just requested that from the Library. Thanks for the head's up.
Started with the MIDI code in Practical Ruby Projects, I'm hashing out a method of generating melodies from runes. Not that I can read runes
Making pancakes!
@raster Please do.
INTERNETS ARE SLOW. BATTON THE HATCHES. ALL HANDS ON DECK.
Procuring iced coffee, then heading to the park to read.
The only mail I ever get anymore is bad news.
When I get a DM from @blissdev, gmail has ads for Air Jordan shoes. I find that hilarious.
There's an insurmountable list of #todo's that need to be done before I move.
Bringing the TweetDeck back. #TweetOverload ?
Add to today's video queue:  ART && CODE SYMPOSIUM session videos. features @_why (WhyTheLuckyStiff)
Need a better system for reading books than throwing everything in Things and setting 1 day deadlines.
@blissdev Even more pressing is how many people look at the twitter website versus using a third party site or a client.
Need a verdict: my new twitter background, too noisy or not? (Click through to my tweet or my profile to see it)
Safari 4 just crashed. OSX didn't offer to send a bug report. That's odd.
Updating my iTunes to keep those evil Palm Pre's at bay.
I'm out of coffee beans. Bah humbug.
Good guys yay!

@gregtarnoff Pride & Prejudice & Zombies has been on my shelf, waiting to be read, for awhile. Did you hear about the sequel?
OH: "You're my level-70 epic mount of love."
OH: "You just peanut buttered me!"
My sinuses are all gross today. I kept leaking all over the PT equipment, and now when I move my head, my teeth hurt. Lame & gross.
Has anyone setup an SVN server as a client to git? IE, scripts clone a git repo & import into an SVN repo on cron? What about a DIY Github?
RT @littletinyfish: A nice expose from @fox6now regarding cyclists and the "Idaho Stop": 
My iTunes has too much bad emo music in it. WTF.
Let me just say that is really hard to have a vegan restaurant in Restaurant City. #fb?
OH: @ashedryden: "This is why we don't make table soup anymore." me: "Then let them eat &lt;div&gt;'s." Yes, we just watched Marie Antoinette.
@JoeSteve I need a geared rear wheel and a fork that fits (probably from a kid's bike) for a project. Need to start going to the Coop again.
@Arlen Even more so, the ones that retweet you because you used one of their keywords (esp. if you didn't hashtag it)
@jennaddenda Back when they started using the word folksonomy, I started using Folksomic vinegar on my tag clouds 
Made some quinoa, now the rice cooker is making some brown rice. Steam some broccoli and tofu and I'll have a very bland, very yummy dinner!
@joshjs RT @IroquoisBay: @mathiasx Yes, all weekend at the lake.
Is there an airshow? Military jets keep circling and buzzing my apartment building, for the past hour or so. #milwaukee
@littletinyfish Is he jumping from one dead industry to the other for sponsors? (Snailmail, tourism, now selling gadgets in physical stores)
Yahoo!Groups doesn't respect my wishes of a 'web-only' subscription. Joy was had by all. Makes me wonder why Yahoo still competes with GOOG.
Just got buzzed by a giant, unseen bug. Now fully awake in respond-to-predators mode and can't find the thing to remove it from the bedroom.
I can remember a time when I was younger: the prospect of fixing a server and writing some code was appealing at this hour. Not anymore. Gah
Is  really as bad as it seems? I can't believe a Discovery Network channel could have such a terrible site.
Can't get into any sort of 'zone' today for anything. Need to pare down feeds and books I'm reading, get my place packed up for the move.
USPS Change of Address worked online in the past, this time it generated a lot of $1.00 charges on my debit card and won't go through. Joy.
Suggestions for things to give away / get rid of during a move? It stills feels like I own way too much stuff.
@cheshster Aha! Thank you, kind sir. Ad privacy settings hidden by an adblocker. Now that's kind of evil.
Trying to turn off the ability of Facebook Ads to use my profile pics, but in Settings-&gt;Privacy-&gt;News Feed...-&gt;Facebook Ads is blank for me.
@talktostrangers Happy birthday! I know I'm a bit late.. I should pay more attention to my friends via Twitter.
This code looks a lot better highlighted in AquaEmacs than MacVim. Too bad I don't know all the META-X-CMD-:-ALT-ARGHBLAGHAFARGLAGH...
Running into the error again where a Rubygem written as a C extension won't compile because I'm on PowerPC. Really need a netbook.
@cheshster We had fireworks in town last night, too. Not to celebrate Utah holidays, though.
tripped over a rubberneck tote in the dark and broke it, stubbed my toe. Feel dumb, but I'm sure the neighbors got a horrifically loud crash
@smutandeggs I'm in packing mode, too.
Back at home.
@abraham congrats on winning the Google I/O Scavenger Hunt. Just now getting that far back into my feeds backlog.
Something-to-geek-out-about Wikipedia article of the day: 
Congrats to all the people that rode in the RW24. Feeling guilty that I was too busy to get down there and watch and/or participate.
Goodwill items donated, old batteries recycled. Ran to Pck 'n Save. Currently nomming a delicious apple. Exhausted.
Also up for grabs: 2x256mb RAM from my (intel) macmini. 200-pin SODIMM DDR2 PC2-5300. All three pieces of RAM could be yours for free!
I have more junk than I thought.
For free to anyone: 256mb 200-pin SODIMM DDR PC2700, came from my Powerbook G4 when I stuck a gig of RAM in it. Fits G4 iBook too, I think.
Packing. Sorted out records/invoices for the past 2-3 years, plus a million scraps of misc paper & receipts. More than a little overwhelmed.
In the realm of MySQL data conversion, having me write a script is a lot cheaper than the time it'd take to copy-paste hundreds of items.
@ashedryden DrupLOLing?

@RiverwestNA Thanks! A few more days and I'll be a full-fledged resident of Riverwest.
Heading over to the bike coop to donate a bike.
Vegan comfort food with the family at Comet Cafe.
Having my family help me pack will inevitably bring the "How was I supposed to know you wanted to keep that?" but I do appreciate their help
Trying to drink black tea all morning instead of a pot of coffee didn't work. Exhaustion, headache & a day of cleaning+packing ahead of me!
Really exhausted.
Going to Fuel for dinner. Gotta love my parents wanting to feed me & my (also vegetarian) brother.
Short 5 boxes. Running to u-haul on capitol & hoping they're not out.
It is interesting that my physical therapy place needs Russian-speaking therapists for its Shorewood clientele.
More packing!
The bike coop guys got me a get-well-soon card. Aww.
Well, I smell delightful.
My ISP just told me today they can't provide DSL service in Riverwest after saying they could. They want a $300 early cancellation fee.
Just ran into @smutandeggs on her way out of town at Fuel.
They're going to be painting my new apt while we're moving in. Better sooner than later.
All out of my apartment. Now to get keys for the new apt at 3pm.
Belongings 90% loaded in truck. So, move is 70% done? It's all downhill from here, right?
Hard to think I trained all of may, got hurt in june. Spent june & july in physical therapy. August and my summer's nearly over
Nice and cool weather makes for an easier move.
On my laptop for a bit before they show up with the truck. We finish this move today!
Shutting down my macmini to pack it.
Watching my 7 year old cousin race go-karts in Dousman, WI.
OH: "Was that the hair that broke the camel's back?"
Just spent the last hour up on a chair cleaning greasy dust off a ceiling fan. Prev tenants obviously never cleaned & only vacuumed the  ...
I just found a dime in the back of a closet. Hooray! It can pay for this txt to twitter!
@svdodge I have a Firewire cable if your Mac needs a little recovery. (If I can find it in my packed stuff)
Reverse-engineering something that's possible in a View to work for a Block in #drupal in raw PHP (gasp! horror!)
My hands are all chewed up from sanding, scrubbing and using harsh cleaning chemicals today. The result? Slightly cleaner apt to be proud of
@corbenfrost Ow, ouch dude.
Eating a late lunch. More mopping and vacuuming and floor waxing to be had! Trips to the hardware store! Adventures in new apartmenting!
Just disassembled the back of my fridge & vacuumed out what must be several decades of cat hair & dust from all the moving parts. Wow, gross
Trying to make it cool off faster in my humid, freshly-painted apartment. Bonus: the bathroom is now sky blue!
Sitting in my new kitchen, listening to Strand of Oaks. Quiet, slightly lonely evening to myself here.
Keep chipping off little pieces towards a better future. It is encouraging, and today is better than yesterday.
Just for posterity, I invented the "sheep tractor", similar to a chicken tractor (  ), back in June of 2009.
@blakehall On Linux, those things and Flash aren't guaranteed to work, depending on the netbook. Big grid of what works: 
@blakehall If I'm finally gonna get a laptop with a webcam, I'd like to be able to actually use it. And wifi working is also a good thing.
Need a netbook with more battery power & LED backlit screen, but I'd have to hack it to run Mac OSX just to get my preferred software stack.
Wondering why my laptop doesn't have a solar panel behind the screen, to charge it when I'm outside and the backlight isn't bright enough.
"The bandwidth is good here, he realizes; and it's not just the bandwidth, it's the whole scene." (Charlie Stross - Accelerando)
It is raining coffee husks and ashes here at Alterra on Humbolt. Come join me, you know you want to!
I am at the Alterra on Humbolt all day, cruising the interwebs, if you'd like to come join me. Coworking? If you want it to be, sure!
I've gotten to the point where every unread item in GReader is a video, but my free wifi spots don't have the bandwidth to watch them.
@Arlen There's a Big Top Chautauqua song with the Lady Elgin in it.
Milwaukee and Comet Cafe made BikeSnob NYC's quiz.
@jbdryden has just claimed that something has exponential awesomeness. I'll need to check his data.
Last.fm just started playing Autumn Leaves done by Cannonball Adderly. Amazing track.
@talktostrangers Isn't it? Every room I get cleaned in my new apt, the more like home it feels; less like a party house that got trashed &gt;.&lt;
@littletinyfish Sign in to the Tweetdeck service in your TD preferences. Make sure your panels/groups are set to share with other machines.
The hard-typing guy and I have an understanding. We watch each-other's laptops & bags when we go get more coffee or run to the men's room.
Guy next to me is one of those keyboard pounders, snapping plastic with every ferocious keystroke. I feel bad for his old Dell laptop.
At Alterra on Humbolt, using their internets. Feel free to stop by & hang out.
I can smell Alterra roasting coffee 2 blocks away, and it is tempting me to go there or make another pot of coffee.
Protip: Used coffee grounds make a nice mulch for planters to prevent them from drying out, and a nitrogen boost for your tomatoes or roses.
@heygabe I'll make more coffee, we'll work on my porch. Deal?
Getting my coffee on, on my porch, in the cool morning. I love this porch, man.
This lightning's gonna keep me from watching my soaps.
Behind schedule on unpacking.
24 hours later, all my txted tweets come through. Fail.
OH: "I need a set of keys." "You're in luck, I'm the Keymaster." I tried not to interject a line about being the Gatekeeper.
I've gotta stay home to let in a repair person. Sorry. Say hi to ppl at the bike coop for me?
If you want a truly heinous smell, clean a closet that was a kitty litterbox, w/vinegar to neutralize. Result:vinegar+ammonia smell. Ugh,gag
Covering everything in contact paper. Hit upon a technique to cover the bottom of a drawer and all four sides with one sheet, no seams.
I feel slightly vindicated when the clock says 2:05 & I've been told to meet at 2PM exactly, like I am wasting their time. Yet, they're late
Repair guy is here. Getting a new window & more!
Cleaning windows & using gorilla glue. Trying to get it all perfect for my brother.Anyone know how to clean the outside of dbl hung windows?
Playing Mr. Fix-it at my new apartment. Wrapping shelves in white contact paper out on my porch, then I'm gonna fix some doors+doorknobs.
I could get used to people cooking me dinner.
@littletinyfish Bliffert's even handled returning a tool I didn't need effortlessly.
Just have to keep myself moving, and it'll all be done soon.
Bliffert Hardware Store gets an A+ from me for service. Seriously impressed & their Riverwest location has been so convenient.
@cthielen Thanks, but I can barely pay the bills now without adding on a capped-bandwidth EVDO card plan.
@kteam It's all about the folding, stick corner overlap to itself, then you lay it down in the drawer in one motion.
Lots of DIY projects today to clean up / finish up my apartment. Managed to mortise a deadbolt striker 3/32" into doorframe with a chisel.
Anyone want to help me build directional wifi antennas and set up an OpenWRT box as a wifi bridge? Frustrated by lack of internets here.
Other ideas: A people-powered moving business that caters to students during the spring/summer move-out season. Would need a lot of gears.
Watching a guy carry a sheet of drywall down the street on his back. Imagining a cargo bike outfitted to haul building materials w/trailer.
Lazyweb: Is there a place in Milwaukee to buy reclaimed/recycled lumber, not for interior-decorating, but cheaper than new at a lumberyard.
@heygabe Contrary to popular belief, the queen ant is not leader of the hive. The group behavior emerges from simple individual actions.
"I'm Walt Mossberg.. SHAT UP." Having too much fun at Alterra right now.
Made friends with an ant. Wondering if he can teach me anything about mechanical engineering.
I'm at Alterra on Humbolt again, come hang out! It's a perfect day to be sitting outside and drinking coffee.
Of course now I'm probably going to get 5 different fingernail grooming kits from people. Doh.
If anyone wants to know what to get for my birthday, I'd really appreciate one of those little brushes for fingernails.DIY is rough on hands
Good day&time to be at alterra with a laptop. Dead in here. Too bad I left my laptop+bag in a room i left to dry after I mopped it.
I've been playing phone tag with at least 4 people all morning.
@Arlen @crnorman I'm just building flower boxes to grow vegetables on my porch. Those 2 options are too high-end for my needs. Thanks though
Dear neighbor: Thank you for not knowing how to secure your wifi or how to rename your network ID from 'linksys' in my time of need
In a McDonalds for the first time in at least 5 years. Not to eat; we're picking up a giftcard for someone.
OH: "I think there's a problem when you start listening to bananas."
I've become addicted to Monster Rancher 2. I blame @ashedryden for introducing me to it.
I keep getting calls from an 888 number scam. They hope you'll call back & then they charge per minute. Profitable if a tiny % call back.
@littletinyfish Use Linux install CD as a means to reformat it as a Windows partition?
Teenage girl, boyfriend & the girl's mom at a table. BF: "I'll buy you all your college party kegs." The mom doesn't flinch. This must be WI
Mint.com doesn't work if you'd like to manually manage  accounts rather than let it login to your bank (my online banking never works)
Hitting the road for Midway..
Reading John Gardner's Grendel in a waiting room. Found this book in a box of free books on Humbolt Ave last week.
The end is just a chance to put another quarter in & try again.
Guy at Alterra has a green messenger bag with Kermit the Frog outline screen printed on. Epic.
"nuns in chucks" sounds like a band that @raster would have been in.
Just got an Initech mug from Goodwill. Working on my best Lundberg impression. Um, we're gonna need you to go ahead and come in on Saturday.
My dad got me a UV pen light. playing CSI over here in the kitty litter closet.
Sartre-quoting intellectuals discussing the American Revolution leave to make way for student beat poets talking about indigenous resistance
Me: "I'm  playing a flash game where you're a Soviet integrated circuit designer." @ashedryden: "lol, you would be." 
John Resig - Eulogy to _why: 
Sad that @_why is gone.
This Mexico Kulaktik at Alterra is really awesome. Just sayin'.
Spilling coffee all over myself at the Humbolt Alterra. Wishing I was at the Grafton Alterra with @ashedryden.
That didn't go well. It wasn't as bad as it could be, though.
Tweeting from my brand new Roadrunner connection.
Kind of amused at the cable guys fearing my mac, insisting on rebooting things (including my laptop) as a means to fix things.
Curry lentil veggie soup for lunch. Yum!
Time warner guy is here to install my Roadrunner. Finally getting internets.
@michaelgoetz Faster than my DSL was!
Freezing in August. Go figure, we have two useless air conditioners that we put in the windows, even.
Enjoying life.
Anyone have an extra DVI cable they're not using?
Got a new driver's license. I look younger on the new license.
Just realized I've had an extreme headache all day and it won't go away. Not a migraine, mind you (but I sympathize with all who get those)
At the Grafton Bizterra. Now I've been to all the Alterras. Gotta catch 'em all!
Going to MATC Mequon so my little brother can buy his textbooks.
@JoeSteve I theorize that what appears to be suspension is actually some sort of spin-out control vanes/flaps built into that fork.
@JoeSteve Like NASCAR cars, it pretends to be a consumer product (fixie bike instead of a domestic sedan) but features a high-tech design
@JoeSteve Hipster Nascar prototype?
RT @littletinyfish: They're preparing to repaint the bike lanes down Oakland just in time for school. Those lines have long since worn away.
@tapps Good luck! Have fun on your bike ride!
@darrickhartman I know. I got myself a pound of coffee and it helped.
Why can't I find enough classes to fill my schedule? Annoying.
The hinge on my Powerbook is starting to feel crinkly, and the frame around the LCD feels a tiny bit loose. Time to retire the Powerbook G4?
RT TeecycleTim: Brewin the coffee... brewin it good.
This just in: @ashedryden IS BarCampMilwaukee4:  That or she's keynoting it.
Headache is back. Caffeine withdrawal? Haven't been buying coffee lately to save money.
Full library of textbooks as ebooks for $35/semester won't be here for a year. Heh.
At Orientation. Not the oldest one here, but not as young as these kids. Can't believe how many raised hands for driving cars to school.
Just got a new dresser for free. It is really nice.
@ashedryden What do the Grafton Bizterra baristas have on the Humbolt baristas? Do they even know your name yet? :P
Anyone have suggestions for a GUI MAME frontend that runs on Linux?
Linux HTPC is getting MAME. Going to challenge my brother to some old school arcade classics.
@abraham Gozerbot has a plugin for that, I think. Python based, plugin architecture, very easily extended.
Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.
@heygabe Godzilla? Nessie? UFOs? Just swamp gas?
Just pulled a towel bar off the wall from the weight of the wet towel, leaving behind two holes in the drywall. Gah.
@svdodge That was pretty slick. Congrats.
So apparently I can't take the classes at the levels I need, assume they'll push me to take classes I *don't* need just to get to 12 credits
Waking up to the smell of Alterra roasting coffee makes brewing a big pot of coffee extremely required.
We're rocking the Netflix tonight.
Anyone using Basecamp on their iPhone? (either the site in Safari or a client app) I'd like to get in touch to compare notes.
@smutandeggs Have fun in Kenosha. I used to live there ;)
watching I'm on a Boat / The Lonely Island on Boxee. check it out at 
watching Speed Racer - s1 | e38 - The Secret Invaders - Part 1 on Boxee. check it out at 
Thinking about a beater winter bike. The Ross Eurotour in the Bike Collective got me started: fenders, internal 3spd hub, bullhorns, lights.
@smutandeggs Yes.
@smutandeggs Have the flickr uploadr software resize them before uploading for you. That helps.
eBay is such a cesspool. Got a "your computer is infected!" fake antivirus pop-up from a search results page. The listings are even worse.
thinking about a bike ride. need to relax.
I have no privacy left.
Carrito de 3 Cajones.
We haven't set up the Roomba, because of this whole Butlerian Jihad business.
@petdance There's a tiny ceramic antenna in the upper right corner. Try setting it on its side? (There are stands for this)
Kernel blew up on the macmini due to an error in the Airport card. Lovely. Was forced to restart in the middle of something and lost changes
Wrist feels really stiff today. Protip: Don't try to lift one of those 70's Schwinn stamped steam road bikes over your head, one-handed.
i must've jinxed it. my phone is now dead-dead. Stealing time on someone's laptop to tweet. Whose laptop? not mine.
I need a new phone. Mine complains constantly of being out of room for txts (10mb of 16mb storage free) & battery died after sending 5 txts.
First day of class over. Took so many notes that my hand is locked in the Vulcan "live long and prosper" gesture.
@ashedryden Now that I've been to your office, I can imagine it smelling like that. That and the scent of fear of mandatory overtime.
Kernel panic! Kernel panic! This Mac's beginning to feel a bit manic!
The Beatles were wrong, happiness is a fast bike.
Contrary to popular belief, there will be no birfday. I'm going in my Vader-style meditation chamber to do my Calc homework. WITH THE FORCE.
@svdodge Yeah, but I'm fairly happy with my fauxberry.
Just got my phone replaced at Verizon for free. Last day of 1 year warranty!
Oh no! @ashedryden left her No.2 pencils here. Hopefully someone at the test center shares.
I like the #goodluckashedryden hashtag even better ^_^
Just saw @ashedryden off. Everyone wish her luck on her test today!
If you all could put #happybirthdaymathiasx on trending topics, you'd be awesome. Just saying.
It's my birthday. Not much more to say than that.
@littletinyfish @JoeSteve The story so far:  white tires, yes. ^_^
Ben's Cycle in Bay View is awesome. Experienced, friendly guys. Hot bikes. Can't say I had experience with their repair service, tho.
@joshjs Calc 2, Physics, and some American History 1492-1877 to round things out. Trying not to overwhelm myself my first semester back.
@CDavis True. I'd like to ride through the winter. Whether or not I'm tough enough to do that is under question.
The good: new wheels for my bike, yay. May yet be able to tear up the streets of Milwaukee before the end of summer.
The bad: my phone is dead and I don't want to get a new one (which will require another 2 year contract rather than month to month)
Whatever happened to predictability? The milkman, the paper boy, evening tv?
@svdodge That's what I was just telling @littletinyfish earlier. Then we can use it as a reference for people to learn at home.
@JoeSteve I can bring it tonight if you want to check it out. Custom PVC  cassette spacers, which have actually held up to use.
@JoeSteve That's my 26" SS rear wheel for my Trek mountain bike, which is gonna get fenders for the winter, I think.
 - Today on This Old Bike, putting monster mountain-bike singlespeed wheels on your 80's Japanese road bike.
Textbooks came, but they couldn't fit in our mailbox, so we have to go pickup at the Post Office. Saved so much money buying used on Amazon.
I'm probably being overly pessimistic about the bike situation. Will bring it by the Bike Coop tonight & try to figure it out.
Status: zombie mode. History class better have a lot of braaaaaiiiiiiiiiins.
Why can't I sleep?
Oak leaf trail closed 350 ft north & south of Capitol dr until 9/20, to install the new WITI antenna. Lame.
New bike hack i just saw: clipping your keychain carabiner to your saddle rails.
Having an early-onset midlife crisis. Need to drop a couple grand on a carbon fiber triathlon bike, then move to the mountains to train.
Wondering why they didn't put the optical trackpad in the spacebar on the Sharp PC-Z1 (new full Ubuntu MID thingie) 
Followed up my nice, healthy lunch with the rest of the birfday cake after class. You've gotta balance things out, you know?
V8 Spicy Hot. Yum, yum, yum. New healthy lunch (replacing a xlarge black coffee) that @ashedryden introduced me to.
@smutandeggs I accidentally a chainsaw the whole tree.
First one to the top of the failtree wins!
@compujeramey row row, fight the powah?
night class is going to mean no Web414 or weeknight bike coop for me.
Looking at the Trending Topics, very disappointed. Dear homophobes: you're not welcome here. Please exit the Twitter in an orderly fashion.
Well that's that. Gah, frustrating.
Anyone have experience with or opinions on the Eighth Inch frame? Looks like a cheap, durable cromoly urban-fixie frame 
@cheshster @ashedryden @corbenfrost You're all fired. Get your things in a box and someone from HR will escort you out of the building.
After a short ride (on old wheels), making a list of everything that needs to be fixed/adjusted on my SS bike. Lots of stuff, unfortunately.
I never get any email. Someone send me some good news.
I want to reprogram the elevators to chime the Star Trek themesong.
Home from night class. Flavorless ripe bananas mean it is time for superthick protein smoothies.
Oh: "he got a parakeet & the parakeet got him a girlfriend."
@corbenfrost wins with the most awesome tshirt: a crayon version of the car scene from the beginning of Reservoir Dogs.
@ashedryden I can be your Lady Gaga, you can be T-Pain.
Today @ashedryden and I are playing a terrible name game. Best so far: Constable Huxtable.
Heading to Comet for some vegan comfort food and coffee here in a bit, with @CorbenFrost in town, plus @ashedryden and @blissdev as well.
You thought your hipster bicycle polo was cool? Try this: 
@JoeSteve @littletinyfish Good luck!
Things just got a little more interesting around here.
Watching Machine Girl with my brother. Curious to see if he enjoys it.
Looking for freelance work and PT work, if anyone's got any leads. Really could use it right about now.
Reading bike repair guides on Park Tool's excellent website:  Learning so that I can do all the work on my bikes myself.
@corbenfrost She's fine. She just needed some Katamari Damacy after a nap to recharge her superpowers.
@schmenzer @alexfalkenberg 19" CRT would be perfect for our needs. The heavier, the better, actually. Less likely to 'walk off' on its own.
Out for a nice long ride on the Oak Leaf.
Watering plants.
@rachelness Congrats! Where did you get it, out of curiosity?
I'd like to find a large old CRT monitor for the Bike Coop (CRT to survive durability requirements) If you have one, I will gladly take it.
Enjoying this nice weather. Didn't it snow in September last year in the Midwest?
Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary breakfastses.
@corbenfrost remains a riot. Well into 2AM territory.
Oh: "I met wil wheaton before he died in a terrible, terrible podcasting accident."
OH: "You're.. cheese?"
This guy swears by Selle Italia Turbo & its reissue  Plus: no leather. Not sure that I can ever justify a $60 seat tho.
I've got an old Selle plastic seat on my SS bike & it's great. Don't need padding or leather cover. Recommendations for new seats like this?
Ice cream bike cart just went by playing music. Wondering if the cooling runs off a battery or dynamo power, or both.
Swearing in public will get you no where with me.
Made vegan shepherd's pie with only leftover food. Quite pleased with myself. Enjoying it on my porch with a glass of chocolate almond milk.
RT ashedryden:  I got broke so @mathiasx and @svdodge fixed me.
Rode to Brown Deer and back with @ashedryden and @svdodge on our bikes. Longest ride since my crash. Feeling great!
Biking on the Oak Leaf & coming up with my own themesong. Mostly kettledrums and Moog synths.
@nic0 I hear a computer monitor with integrated webcam works great in place of a mirror, actually. :P
Morning walk over to alterra for coffee beans. Relaxed, ready to put in a solid day of studying.
Rode on a deserted Oak Leaf in the dark. The 9-LED flashlight I picked up from Bliffert Hardware on sale just doesn't cut it as a headlight.
Beautiful weather makes me want to be outside biking. Instead I'm cooking so I can make it to my 5PM night class on time.
@compujeramey Might be too long, but I'd like to ride from DT south, thru Grant Park, west on the parkways, ride back along Menomonee River.
It looks like the Bike Coop is going to be open for volunteer work again while I'm in my night class. Gah. Not a fan of my new schedule.
@EighthInch Can't wait for my order to get here ;)
Just saw a cool idea on Vimeo. Photography ride, like a photowalk on bikes. Tag @ashedryden @svdodge @compujeramey anyone else?
Someone recommend a movie to watch with my brother.
Street theatre between a skateboarder and some wannabe thugs. Compelling.
Made some bean burritos, heading to the bike coop soon.
@ashedryden I only got one BarCamp tshirt per event. No fair!
Still looking for PT and freelance/contract work. Any leads would be appreciated.
@compujeramey Any routes that you can think of from downtown that would be more photogenic?
@compujeramey re:photoride: On 2nd thought, maybe just Downtown to Menononee River path & back. Maximize photography time, not biking time.
I need a "Don't show me this until tomorrow morning" filter for my webcomics in GReader.
@ashedryden I'm proud of you. &lt;3
Ugh. Vertigo. Wonderful.
I still need to pay for textbooks. Anyone have work they need done this weekend? Server admin, Drupal installs, script hacking, etc.
@littletinyfish I'm hanging up the Miyata until I can afford to have a framebuilder true and get it clearcoated. Want to preserve it.
@littletinyfish Was just about to RT that. Sounds like it'll do fine as my new commuter bike. Certainly not going to thrash it with tricks.
I wanted to be more involved in Web414 and helping with organizing the next BarCamp Milwaukee. Instead, I've got class tonight. Gah.
Waiting for the
Home from the Bike Coop.
Oh: "i'll be that lane pirate. I'll bogart two lanes." - @svdodge in a traffic jam.
The more I ride my bike, the more I want to cycle, the more I think about bikes. It is a terrible yet awesome addiction.
@chrisgauger & I rode down to the island across from the summerfest grounds, past the art museum. hanging out before we head back.
Back from a very late lunch with @chrisgauger and @ashedryden. Weather is perfect for biking. Need to drag along @chrisgauger.
Now is gnat season. Great swarms of them everywhere.
Oh: "i don't want mice wearing my vegetables."
Anyone else heading down to the bike-in movie tonight? @svdodge?
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of bandwidth.
Also, my camera's li-ion battery decided that today was a good day to die. I didn't know that Canon made batteries in the Klingon empire.
History class in a bit. Covering some of my favorite topics in American History today (at least I hope we get that far)
So much for neighborhood watch. Saw a domestic dispute from my porch, dozen people walked by & didn't get involved, cops never got here.
I don't understand why so many people that ride bikes also smoke.
Bike Collective stand current status: me, on the curb, reading Cog magazine & drinking coffee. Grabbed us some shade tho.
At center str, walking around. Dunno how to tell where the bike coop's stand should be. All seems rather first-come, first-serve.
I'll be over at Center Str Days all day in the Milwaukee Bicycle Collective stand. Come stop by!
Morning.
Still feel like there's a wealth of information on Park Tool's howto bike repair section that I have to cover.
Stayed up late last night watching HACKERS with the @chrisgauger and the @ashedryden. Coffee time is nao!
@smutandeggs Enjoy Duluth! Beautiful up there!
OH: "i went to go buy ice cream & there was this creepy baby doll there."
thanks again for the bike hookup, @svdodge. Rode a nice distance with @chrisgauger today on the oak leaf and then up to Estabrook to relax.
@raster I LOVE robots as a matter of fact.
Hah, I didn't know twitpic comments posted to twitter. Nice.
@ashedryden  - I don't think that seat is big enough. Can we get a bigger seat in here?
@MoCheeks Hackers the movie, yeah.
Inspiring community bike org story:   from Boulder's Community Cycles.
Awesome bike ride today. 10.5 miles up to the entrance of Brown Deer Park and back. Beautiful weather today.
Riding through Kletzche park with @chrisgauger.
Wind is flavored with hints of sewage today. Lovely.
Road drops considered too, I guess.
Bikepeeps: Anyone have a pair of riser bars on a 1 1/8" threadless stem I could buy cheap?
OH: "Don't put your flash drive into a computer without a yellow cable. If there are viruses, the network will clear them from your drive."
Check out the end of this video where the bodybuilder is explaining he bought a fixed gear bike 'because it is cool now' 
OH: "Are you twitter-dumping me?!"
Grabbing old cabinet sewing machines on the side of the road for my mom. Way more work than it is worth, I think.
Apparently "I'm from downtown, son! I'm not playin' around!" is a threat hurled between 8 year olds in this neighborhood.
@littletinyfish I guess I was really just asking what is cool about following road racing, which you answered. Thanks.
@littletinyfish haha. true. I didn't tweet that, though it would have been funny. "@littletinyfish help i fell, in ambulance. bbl."
@littletinyfish Bike Polo is exciting and local, so I can see going to watch that. Most of these races happen outside of my 'local' bubble.
Got a box of stickers and handbills from @eighthinch if anyone is interested. Going to be handing them out around town & spreading the word.
@littletinyfish Not really into watching sports. The rest, including @ashedryden's, are simulations of things you can't do IRL already.
@littletinyfish Riding your bike and watching some dudes ride a bike race is two different things. I dunno, I'd rather be riding, personally
@littletinyfish What's the draw of following cycling events like the Tour of Missouri? Or even the Tour de France? Just curious.
If these guys paid as much attention to the math in class as they do the stats in WoW. WoW-talk, make it stop...
@Narkalant Dude. Awesome.
A gumstix.com computer would fit better. Wondering if we could run ethernet cable discreetly all the way down the shared stairwell for PoE.
We don't have a doorbell; thinking we need one that tweets -&gt; txt our phones. DC from old doorbell line, wifi? Beagleboard in the doorframe?
@chrisgauger I thought it smelled like the cigarettes maids smoke while they clean hotel bathrooms. Wait, we don't have a maid. DUN DUN DUN.
Be Kind, Don't Leave a Rider Behind: 
Smells like baking bread and roasting coffee over here in Riverwest. Yum.
@svdodge And relaxed pace, consistent time and place to meet & return to, etc. Those are important bits I couldn't fit in the initial tweet.
On the other end of the stick (the lycra and carbon fiber stick), it wouldn't be a fixed-gear-only bar crawl, either.
Looking to start a weekly bike ride that isn't "road race training." Start at the Holton Marsupial Bridge, 15-20 mi ride. Anyone interested?
Headache. Where's my coffee?
@Giania totally. how I sign up for sites: domain.com -&gt; myaddress+domain@gmail.com. Filter it to tag bacn & other tags/actions as needed
@Giania The part after the + can be anything. I use +twitter etc to know where things come from. @IronRinn is saying they do the same thing.
Enjoying a quiet evening out on the porch. Nice and cool out. Playing the remastered The Beatles' 1 for Riverwest; so far no complaints.
My tomato plant from the RW Coop (got it free!) is finally flowering. Looks like we may have tomatoes sooner than I thought!
Clarification: He/she tried to squeeze by me on Weil w/ parked cars on both sides. Honked & proceeded to drive past, forcing me off the road
Just got ran off the road (into parked cars) w/a honk by a red Ford, license plate "WWW DOT" in RW. I'd like to have a word with this person
The time has come to PUSH THE BUTTON.
He lives to fight another day. The crowd goes wild!
Stolen bike alert:  Don't steal bikes, bro!
In need of a "Life has no brakes, neither does my bike" tattoo ASAP.
@schmenzer Not as much response as I had hoped. But I want to start holding it, just to ride more. If you build it, they will come, etc.
@schmenzer Was checking out your site and Schlick Cycles. The Shark looks like a blast!
@schmenzer Yeah, I'm fine and so is the bike.
@smutandeggs Come on down! bring your bike! sleep on our air mattress!
What's with today, today?
Headed to the Milwaukee Bicycle Collective with @chrisgauger. Can only stop in for a bit tonight.
Discussing the healing properties of burritos versus swine flu.
@ashedryden I thought he was sending Ship-to-shore telegrams like the role @svdodge plays in The Royal Tenenbaums.
@schmenzer That'd be awesome!
@heygabe I dig the shirt. But haven't we, as geeks, gotten over the black beefy tee's for more comfortable & more sunlight-compatible fare?
Iced my hand (sore from taking notes & not writing for years) for a good half hour. can't feel anything except the pain now. Gah.
@littletinyfish That's one nice track bike! then ;)
@svdodge I hear the Specialized Body Geometry gloves are good stuff. Need to get some gloves myself, that's what I plan to get.
Why does Google always give me e-commerce results for .co.uk sites? Is there some setting I screwed up?
@littletinyfish That's a whole bike, man!
@schmenzer Banner vinyl runs 15-25mil rather and usually has some sort of ripstop in it as well.
@schmenzer Need thicker stuff, like the banners for sales/concert promo. Making my own backpack that I can bike with. Thanks for the offer!
@chrisgauger really gouged his finger deep the other day. Hoping it heals on its own without needing a trip to a walk-in type place.
Anyone know where I can grab some vinyl signage scraps? (graphic design / marketing places, dumpsters, etc) Let me know!
Going to the bank to do bank stuffs. Yawn.
@EighthInch Those Julians are awesome. Making me wish I had a bombproof wheelset that was all blinged out.
Wondering if there is space to screenprint "don't steal bikes, bro" on Kryptonite u-locks. I mean, err, nonlethal hipster self-defense tools
@svdodge lives in a bike house.
@svdodge Is the Sartorialist franchised out to various cities now?
@svdodge I aspire to ride a bike no-handed and eat a huge burrito at the same time.
Do not eat too fast.. do not eat too fast.. oh hell, OM NOM NOM NOM!
@riverwest One block south of Locust on Humbolt, around the corner from us. There were cops in cars swarming all over abour an hour ago.
@schmenzer I may. I'd rather ride the SS down to Bay View than the old rusted Trek 800 MTB I use as a winter bike.
@rohdesign I believe you share your anniversary date with @ashedryden and @jbdryden.
Something went down in Riverwest today or last night. There's not usually so many cop cars, police photographers, and detectives in one spot
Was going to try to true the wheels on my Miyata SS but don't have a spoke wrench and don't want to strip things. Oh well.
@svdodge I should probably be catching up on my reading, too.
Not a fan of the ambiguity of "next" and "previous" links at the bottom of blogs. Infinite scrolling ala soup.io wins here.
Anyone from the Milwaukee Bicycle Collective want to build a beater frame into a skibike this winter? 
@littletinyfish @JoeSteve I'll make sure to use Milwaukee Bicycle Collective in all future conversations.
@JoeSteve @littletinyfish Ah, sorry. Easier to type on cellphone ;)
Telling classmates to check out the MKE Bike coop at bay view bash. Good word of mouth publicity :)
@cheshster Forgot to DM it to the person it was meant for. Corrected.
@ashedryden Am I still grounded? Can I go out and play now?
history test in a bit. tonight some fun planned with the MKE bike coop, picking up a huge load of bikes.
Sticker wallet pics: 
It takes exactly 10 of these 8" long stickers to make the bifold wallet. I can make two more wallets with what is left.
Using a bunch of old stickers to make a wallet, the same way duct tape wallet is made. Going to adorn it with old startup schwag stickers.
Didn't get the shot with my digital camera last night that I wanted. Hrm. Maybe next week.
Slow morning, made me just want to crawl back in bed.
Just need a little sleep. Gah.
@rohdesign HEY ADOBE IM REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU AND IMA LET YOU FINISH BUT LET ME SAY THIS. CS2 WAS ONE OF THE BEST SUITES OF ALL TIME.
@ashedryden EVERY SIGN-UP IS YES.
"I know, but it's a Wordpress site, not a Drupal site." "Well, it's doing a bad job. It should email me. I'm gonna go sign up again."
@janiukjf Ahoy matey!
Can't get to facebook. Need to get to Facebook for something. Woe is me.
Well, tonight isn't getting any better, is it?
@smutandeggs & whistle to the ships that are bound for the bay and running for a lee?
@smutandeggs You're the keeper of the light on Michigan Island, shadow in the night for the steamboat trade? With an eye on the wick &
Hello, headache. I acknowledge your presence.
Home. Tired. Grocery shopping already?
My pants aren't tight enough for Bay View.
Inventing the helmet-mounted steadycam with @raster.
Hanging out at @schmenzer's shop. About to head down to Bay View Bash.
Wondering whether I'm too sick for all the things I have planned today.
Not an awesome morning.
I want to go for a bike ride right now, but I can't find the little LED flashlight I use as a headlight. Fail.
Need to make some tea.
Hair status: growing it out, with sideburns, for Beatles Rock Band.
@ashedryden I much prefer the session: Encase yourself in a bubble made from iPhones to distance yourself from friends and colleagues!
Talking co-evolution of humas & humans parasites, climate change, and factors of time over breakfast sat hotch-a-do.
Feel like I'm oblivious to the important things in my life, sometimes. and now that is catching up to me.
@raster I'll be reloading your flickr photos page constantly until that one shows up.
GO FASTER
Home, finally. Had a blast biking down Water at night with @svdodge on the way back.
I did just beat a roadie on a nice bike on @ashedryden's mixte though.
Sam is faster around the island, and I cheated.
Leaving for the first Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride. Tonight is just scouting for possible routes with @svdodge, @ashedryden & @chrisgauger.
@heygabe I don't use the word processor docs, either.
Increasingly finding myself throwing everything in a Google Doc spreadsheet. structured rich text, portability & easy sharing tops txt files
What's the going rate for tiny USB thumb drives? 8 gigs for $20?
In a class among luddites. Will haved to keep my use of technology terms to a minimum from now on.
One more cup of peppermint tea. One. More.
Tabulating.
Of all the things I could be doing: all my projects, all the books I could be reading, I want to make "surfing the web" less of that time.
@raster I've got a powered USB hub foryour time lapse bot, next time I see you. I'll throw it in my bag now so I don't forget it.
@gregtarnoff I dig it.
@smutandeggs Another set of pics of that thing: 
@smutandeggs re: folding bikes. I always wanted one of these:  I have weird bike tastes tho
@smutandeggs haha. awesome.
@smutandeggs Then again, that folding bike converted to fixed gear for bike polo is pretty sweet.
@smutandeggs Could do a 24" wheel BMX bike build up. The 3 speed hub would help on those hills, and changing the chainring/cog gearing, too.
@blissdev Just checked. Pirates of the Caribbean 2. Won it at the F1 Overnight Challenge when I wasn't even in the room.
@blissdev I've got a blu-ray movie you can have for that PS3. I'll never be able to watch it.
Gah I want to build a drum-brake internally geared 3 speed cruiser bike for winter now.
@smutandeggs And this one is cool: apehanger bars, internal geared 3 speed hub, banana seat: 
@smutandeggs on fixed gear BMX conversions: 
Working on roll-top backpack design for bike commuting through the winter. Not sure if I'm gonna be able to make it w/tools+materials I have
@svdodge 'Songs to bike to' playlist? As much as I discourage iPod-while-cycling listening, I'd be curious to see what goes on there.
@mariehuynh Bikes are all love and bunnies and rainbows.
@offwhitemke Free to AT&T broadband customers, not that I'm a customer of their broadband or their cell service.
@lakeicychill I've learned that local televised news is terrible at that kind of thing, and reporting the right name to the right face.
Decided today that wheels should be able to withstand bunny hops off a curb. Any that get bent need to GTFO my bike. Also, bent my wheels.
Brian Eno's Music for Airports is the soundtrack while I complete the take-home portion of the first exam for my Calculus-2 class.
@svdodge Your new stuff on flickr is really awesome. Digging the look you got at the wedding, even though I don't know the photography terms
RT @svdodge: Trackstand on a mixte, by @mathiasx 
Next week Monday: Mondays-in-Milwaukee Bike Ride. 6PM, Veteran's Memorial on the lakefront. Tell your friends! We'll be done by 8PM sharp!
@smutandeggs Cool bike o' the day:  If you wanna haul stuff, that is.
15.04 miles for @chrisgauger and I today, by Google Earth's reckoning. Not bad for a casual ride through Milwaukee.
@raster Thanks!
I'd say the first Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride went really well.
Slipped on the stairs due to flat, treadless soles on my shoes.. Shoulder status; not dislocated. Winnar.
Just passed @tronathon on his bike in the rain on Commerce Str a minute ago.
I need to get a bike commuter backpack that's waterproof in the rain and snow. Gah.
@lyndzi RT @hanneloreEC: a BOY said HELLO to me today at the bookstore STOP TALKING TO ME STRANGE BOYS I DON'T KNOW
Hate when feeds are headline-only on a blog that primarily posts pictures, not text even.
@rachelness SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING. Alternatively, get a can of aerosol Lysol and spray anyone that coughs or sneezes.
Lazyweb: Free self-hosted webapp or application that works like HarvestApp.com? Open source would be great.
Morning drags on.
PURPLEMEAL
Etoile de Dakar's Xalis for night music.
@ashedryden  - My vegan burrito at hotch-a-do. yum!
Finishing my Monday by getting ahead in studying.
Overheating.
The fact that i can't find my bike headlight is extremely lame. Tore apart the house looking for it, too
Need more momentum.
BikeSnobNYC turned off full feeds in favor of a short blurb from the text of each post. Frustrating.
Gained lovely wrench bruises on both hands for trying to get a locktited bolt out. Learned my lesson.
I need to stop forgetting the 'd Person' when trying to DM from my phone &gt;.&lt;
Bolts for replacing @chrisgauger's car's side mirror seem to be loctite'd on, and I only have a little bit driver.
@corbenfrost You gonna come up for BarCampMilwaukee4? Oct 3rd-4th, can give you a place to crash if you want.
@JoeSteve What's battery life like?
@Tmtx Step up would be something like  which I'll get to eventually.
@Tmtx I'm starting with embroidery hoops, discount mesh from craft store, and a little bottle of permanent soy ink. Not crazy money.
@rachelness you can still pick it up from the air. I need one of those cleansuits.
Shopping with @chrisgauger. Everything is way too expensive :/
Wishing I felt a little more confident in the answers on the test I just handed in.
I see sick people. everywhere. And i ran out of hand sanitizer.
@KeVroN Someone else is going to have to sell their soul to the Borg. On the other hand, MS says they try to get local media to come report
@riverwest That's a little harsh. Riverwest is far friendlier at the neighbor-level than other places I've lived.
@Tmtx Screen-printing! that's my new relaxing hobby, at least.
Someone should use the Host-a-Windows-7-launch-party site to request a free copy of Windows 7 for an install session at BarcampMilwaukee4!
Squirrels are tiny ninjas.
Left a bunch of stuff out on the porch in the rain. Forgot to put away leftovers from dinner last night. I am so awesome right now.
Shake it up, shake it down.
@Tmtx Timbuk2 is like, the evil empire now. So I heard.
@ashedryden We met in person, first. You just didn't remember me, because I apparently wasn't very memorable.
It is a 4 cop car kind of night, apparently.
Trying to help @chrisgauger get a door open after the handle fell off, via txt
Eating the WORLD'S BLANDEST MEAL.
@ashedryden Kill it with fire, it is the only way to be sure!
@compujeramey Where should that money come from? Just curious. Maybe if they were allowed to use the road tax? (I know they can't currently)
@EighthInch Secret zoobomber model is go?
There may be wisdom in crowds, but they're still all idiots.
@littletinyfish @svdodge Just made a new group-tmblr. mkebikespotting.tumblr.com DM or @reply for invite to contribute.
First world problem: Trying to find another IM protocol to talk to someone when GTalk dies. "I can't use Facebook Chat at work." etc
Guy rode by on a 60's Schwinn kid's bike w/20" wheels. Has apehanger bars & a long seatpost+comfort seat, now he's got a nice little cruiser
@offwhitemke By the time your iPhone contract is up, hopefully both Apple and carriers have moved on & you'll have another choice.
Blasting Journey's Lights. Because I am that hardcore.
The lazy, manual way is taking me longer. Should've done something with the Flickr API for what I'm doing.
Not nearly in shape, and my shoulder is suffering from lack of attention. Gah.
No one is here for class. Did I miss an email or an announcement last time? Gah. Waited all afternoon here for this class.
Tumblr bookmarklet is kind of failing at posting images from flickr. Joy.
Featuring @frutiger in the pics of the Riverwest 24 on mkebikespotting.tumblr.com because I can.
@littletinyfish Added. Thanks for the RT!
Warwalking MATC to find some wifi.
Milwaukee bike peeps: submit your pics to @mkebikespotting & check out 
@Tmtx Making a bag is harder than expected. Planning to get one of these:  & customizing.
This whole cafeteria needs to STFU.
@Tmtx Thanks, but I've got a medium Timbuk2. They're 1600cu.in. Not nearly enough volume, and I can't do one-shoulder straps on my shoulder.
I would welcome a ruggedized Kindle that replaced heaviest 3 items. MATC won't have DRM ebook option until 2011, will not be kindle compat.
Bag contents on Tues/Thurs: Calc textbook (5lbs), physics book (5lbs), laptop(5.5lbs), notebooks, calculator, pens, dinner. Bag too small :/
@ashedryden Just don't lose any files you can't afford to lose :P Everything else is inconsequential.
Hangin' out with my best bud, Taffertown.
Tired of douchebags trying to run me off the road when they've got an empty left lane to use. Purposely running me off, even.
In the hall of the chipmunk king right now
Riding past the @tapps estate for the 4th & final time today, on my way home.
OH: "Farmers Against Airport Expansion." "That's a great potential band name."
Made it to Cedarburg in time for lunch. Fuck yeah.
Passed the @tapps estate three times before getting un-lost on my bike. Gotta love riding in 45mph car traffic
Fun bike fact o' the day: before carbon forks were popular, Rock Shox made a version of their Judy suspension fork for road bikes.
Pounding the pavement on my bike. Feel great today.
Trying to decide which bike to take today. Heavy and slow (and more effort) or singlespeed with chance of breakdown? Hmm.
Scheming in Google Earth.
OH: "What's the velocity on this turkey?" my professor referring to a point mass with wings.
@cheshster And this was so much easier than starting a wordpress.com or blogspot group blog, much less install Drupal or Wordpress somewhere
@cheshster You're right. But tumblr doesn't import from soup so well, either. I tried at mathiasx.tumblr.com (should import mathias.soup.io)
I am contradiction boy tonight.
Loud music + dishes = rock out productively.
@littletinyfish Ban the whole lot until the pump comes back?
@JoeSteve yfrog?
Drunk people in my hallway better STFU.
@JoeSteve Thought you meant bike tires there for a second.
@smutandeggs What are you getting?
Not that owning up to it makes a difference.
@ashedryden Yeah. S and D are right next to each other. Go figure I would screw up typing when I'm upset.
Myself & others have been willing to help but have no idea what needs to be done. Don't jump down our throats because we suggest something.
Argument of the morning: Don't plan an unconference behind closed doors, expecting no one to help, & then complain that no one wants to help
@littletinyfish @jeffmke Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride (site on the way), Mondays at Veteran's Memorial on the lake, 6PM-8PM. We just started it
I hate when you wash & rinse a glass/mug/etc, and you can still taste the dish soap on it. Went back & rinsed again, still can taste it. WTF
@smutandeggs You've got drops, right? Maybe try a riser bar cut down to width and a shorter stem? We could do that the MKE Bike Collective..
Recycled old bike innertubes to use as tomato vine supports/ties. Nice!
Potential band name: Handsome Ransom.
Nothing on hulu.. nothing on netflix. Gah, I give up.
RT @offwhitemke: New Belgium's "I'm on a Bike!" Spoof, enjoy.  (via @newbelgium)
Sounds like Mondays-in-Milwaukee ride is canceled this week due to weather. Sorry to anyone who was interested in it for the late notice.
Freezing.
@svdodge It's AIR. It's pretty good background music, sorta mood-lifting.
Have been blasting the stream of the new AIR album since I got home.
This wind and all the falling leaves are destroying my lettuce plants. My tomatoes probably won't get enough warm days to bear fruit. Lame.
Just made it home on the bike. Seems I beat the rain, or at least a drizzle. That wind was killing me.
@jeffmke Hope for nice dry weather next week, and plan to dress for warmth :D
2 hours later, we have still not established why weight is the not same as mass in the collective understanding.
Entertaining myself by watching the windows xp screensaver bounce around.
More night class tonight. Not really happy to spend tonight there.
@chrisgauger got a free portable DVD player. I just fixed it by parking the laser head assembly back towards the center of the disc.
frustrated by the amount of junk I'm required to carry in my wallet, and how much my wallet has ballooned. and I don't even carry cash.
Just described Critical Mass in bigger cities and their methods as "the Greenpeace of biking" to someone. Pretty accurate in my book.
Mashup song of random lyrics from Beach Boys and the Beatles over a busted up beat, is weird. Heard in the background of a Japanese bike vid
Saw a picture of a bike shop with an espresso bar inside it in a picture in Cog Magazine. Awesome idea.
@offwhitemke so do I.
@chrisgauger brought me bright red 700c tires from the Great White North, for my new bike. Rad.
This site is awesome 
@Lyndzi Outre de avec votre tête!
I've been practically living in this thermal fleece sweatshirt for the past 3 days. Brr. Cold.
Going to need some coffee before the Bike Collective tonight, to keep me warm. Will run over to Alterra after our early dinner.
Worst mad scientist class ever.
Zombie threat level: magenta.
&lt; Insert every classic rock chorus here. &gt;
The thermostat is green.. The thermostat is green.. The thermostat is green.. The thermostat is red.. The thermostat is green..
Free slogan for the taking: "Make every day a Beersday."
@chrisgauger made burritos and they are hella tasty.
breathing water vapor
My soul needs a lint roller.
Milwaukee bike folks: follow @cranksgiving and consider riding in this alleycat for an awesome cause (food for the hungry) on Nov 14th!
Four cups of cheap green tea is not nearly the awesomeness of a pot of good coffee. Sadly, I'm out of coffee and nearly out of tea..
@ashedryden Coconut Records (indie pop solo project featuring actor Jason Schwartzman)
@ashedryden The Dead Weather
@gregtarnoff Avacados are terribly violent creatures and best peeled and smooshed for safety. Eaten only occasionally.
@joshjs Must be a Shorewood old building thing. Had centipede issues in my Shorewood apartments.
3 layers of clothes, boot socks, 2 blankets and a quilt. Still freezing. Fail.
@joshjs #youmaynotusethistag either.
Cleaning road grime off old bike parts.
Tonight @ the MKE Bike Collective: tearing down the Miyata. Rebuilding the headset & bottom bracket. Truing wheels if there is time.
I'm not nearly hip enough for the Third Ward / MIAD neighborherd.
When I was arrested, I was dressed in black...
@Giania You dreamt you were batman? Cool!
Wearing thick wool boot socks in an attempt to be warmer, today.
Fictional potato salesmen.
I am alive, I am alive, and that is the best that I can do.
@matthusby Another Matt at BarCamp Milwaukee4! We should meet up and have a Matt Session ;)
Happy Birthday @rohdesign!
@ashedryden has groupies. She is the awesomest person in this room.
At @ashedryden's session on Separating Life and Work at #bcmke4.
Joking around behind the super-popular google wave session with @raster's helmet cam @barcampmilwaukee #bcmke4
@raster I'm in charge of bikes, yes.
I said no cats, man. Don't blame me.
How would you do a portfolio site for a coder who wants to display contributions to open source projects & code snippets? Is a blog better?
Can we get some more coffee at #bcmke4? Thought it was worth asking.
In @ashedryden's Geeks and Sex session. #bcmke4
OH: Hah, I made a COBOL joke. I don't know COBOL.
Ethiopian Cottage has a lot of customers tonight, which is good.
I need BarCamp Milwaukee every month.
Weirdest bike bag loadout yet: Plate wrapped in my windbreaker, hair dryer, clif bars, bike tools, window sealing strips, and extra shoes.
@chrisgauger just got here and he's got a new bike for tonight's Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride!
@offwhitemke Nice spot. Lots of good stuff within walking distance.
@raster I was bragging about your time lapse bot today, so the sooner a video link can be emailed around, the better.
@gregtarnoff Is cost a factor? Netbooks all have Atom CPUs. I like thin & lights; some have faster SSD, more battery life, higher resolution
@raster @whil You can always get your kids to come to BarCamp, and then take all the shirts for yourself. Heh.
Still smells like cigarette smoke in my apartment. And I've got 3 HEPA air purifiers on full blast. So pissed, and sick. Grr.
In bldg where the landlord won't do anything about it, I bet. Don't want to be out confronting assholes at 6:30am w/strongly worded requests
Woke up to an apartment full of cigarette smoke. Am highly allergic to it. Can only guess some asshole didn't want to go out in the cold.
Tonight's sleep is brought to you by Polynomial long division 
Everything bad for you is good again.
Starbucks Via ReadyBrew packet in a cup of boiling water. Tastes nasty, but it is warm and somewhat coffee-like.
I unmasked @joshjs  #unmasked
@heygabe That is a fish. Good eye.
Thanks to @heygabe's skateboard antics this weekend, I'm browsing the decks in a skate clothing catalog that came for my brother.
Braindead. Manipulating symbols on paper.
@KeVroN Word. 
Post-BarCamp real-life suckage. Oh hey, I have a bottle of Water Joe though..
Looks like it is going to be a beautiful day for the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride! 6pm @ the Veteran's Memorial. Dress warm & bring a light ;)
Wish i had my bike today.
Dogs dream about chasing squirrels in their sleep, I dream about riding bikes in traffic.
@cranksgiving Is the after party going to be all-ages or 21+? Just curious.
Ground the coffee beans with my teeth. Grrr. Manly.
@svdodge I am unsure of my own intentions. Using this as my new avatar, in any case.
@raster Unplug for awhile. Go enjoy some fine literature.
I need to get my bike built.
@svdodge Yeah, he's got a flip-flop with a cog on there. He's just going to get more comfortable with it before he flips to fixed, I think.
@svdodge He's got good off-the-line speed. Sugino Messenger chainring and cranks, nice parts all around. Diagnosing chain tension right now.
@svdodge @chrisgauger's new bike is fast. Aluminum frame and carbon fiber fork, singlespeed 42/16. Track drop bars.
@svdodge Rode fast. Up the lakefront, thru the east side: Prospect to LakeDr to Newberry. Up to Estabrook &back. Really enjoyable night ride
Tonight's Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride had a furnace repair checkpoint. I didn't fix it, so no points for me.
Headed to the MKE Bike Collective with @chrisgauger's new bike for some final tweaks.
Experiment: Have the new iTunes fill the iPod entirely with the "Fill free space with songs" option instead of the smart playlists I've made
@whil Beans, whole grains, quinoa (excellent with rice! adds a nutty flavor + crunchy texture), tofu/seitan/tempeh, & fresh veggies in bulk.
I think my diet has been lacking in protein. So it is probably good that tonight I made black bean and brown rice burritos.
@whil my knees are complaining after this bike ride too. Heavy, slow mountain bike on road + wind both ways + going 'fast enough' did me in.
Threw my chain once already. Riverwest to Oakleaf to Prospect, up the East side to Kletzsch Park & now back again.
Out thrashing bikes with @chrisgauger.
@Arlen "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."
Covered in Tafferdon fur, despite using the lint roller. doh.
Here comes the sun king.
@jeffmke @gregtarnoff That txt msg came through about 24 hours too late. Sorry about that.
Trust me, I'm am amateur. #socialmedia
Can anyone link me to some gmail minimalism tips? Feel like I've got a Rube Goldberg device of Labs, inboxes & multiple accounts currently.
I really dislike people. Especially those who ruin a good thing like BarCamp.
"You don't have a bike, you have a frame. You can't talk." -- @chrisgauger insulting me.
@svdodge I got a new winter bike: 
OH: "What is this, a college douchebag convention?"
@raster @heygabe What's the plan for Web414  ? I might be able to meet you afer class.  (Web414 live &gt; 
I"m hoping for a wifi signal in class tonight, so that I can attend web414 via IRC. If there's enough pipes, maybe even ustream in.
@smutandeggs Cranksgiving starts a block from my apt. @chrisgauger & I are in. also planning to make pancakes for friends that morning, here
One again, some of my txted tweets are arriving way late, 48+ hours late. The history professor tweet was sent on Monday..
In the words of Elvis Costello, "What's so funny about peace, love & understanding?"
Just had an argument with my history professor over whether the earth can be millions of years old. He thinks in Biblical dates apparently.
Dear older generation: Your time is up. Stop legislating your conservative 'values' & 'morals' on us and let us create the world we deserve.
@chrisgauger flipped his bike to fixed gear & took a natural talent to trackstanding. Envious of his mad skillz.
I've got a clipless mtn bike shoe stuck in a SPD clipless pedal (not attached to a bike/crank) if anyone knows how to free it, let me know.
@ashedryden is getting her wisdom teeth out right now. Everyone wish her a speedy recovery!
Regurgitated newstand headline: We can now grow liver cells out of skin. "Have another beer, youve got plenty of skin!"
Damn. I forgot my ipod for the bus ride home.
Made it all the way through my night class & got to go to 2 meetings for groups I love tonight. Sorry that I couldn't stay longer at web414.
@smutandeggs There's a B Category for people who just want to ride & have a good time, instead of race it. #cranksgiving
Class is out. Running(literally) to @web414 now.
@web414 @raster @heygabe can we get some lights and louder audio on the ustream?
Spend 4 hrs helping install plastic film on other's windows so that I can learn to do it on my apt awesomely for my perfectionist tendencies
@corbenfrost I was out in it all morning & last week when it rained. just because you guys choose to live stacked on top of each other..
We have more wind than Chicago (scientific fact) but we don't complain about it as much in Milwaukee.
OH: Paul, you iz a werewilf.
OH: I am a robot. I have no feelings. That makes me sad.
@smutandeggs Too thick?
@blissdev Minimalism is good, sure. But otherwise it doesn't have any contrast. Bike looks like I spray-painted it white. You know?
@blissdev I need some good stickers for it. Frame looks so bland right now.
I crashed into a chainlink fence. It came out of no where! Also, didn't have any brakes on the bike I was borrowing.
@blissdev Err, no.
Need to build a nice tough little polo bike to add to the stable.
All's fair in love and bike polo (or robot wars)
@Giania "The world is ROOOOOOOOOOOUND!" (as in, "My parents are deaaaad!")
Tomorrow is Talk Like Christopher Columbus Day!
@trodrigues Beard acquired.
Hair is growing long again. Time to get out the acoustic guitar and start a folk-rock cover band?
@mkebikespotting has some new stuff for your viewing: 
@lakeicychill @joshjs Congrats on being alive, and such.
Need some more content for @mkebikespotting. C'mon, guys! Submit something ;)
@heygabe #HappyBirthdayGabe :D
@svdodge Try putting them in a paper bag with an apple in it. Seal the top with a clothespin.
It is supposed to rain Monday, so I'm calling off Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride early. Anyone know if Bike Polo is happening in MKE tomorrow?
I'm not in any of my bike polo pics because I forgot to ask someone to take pictures while I played. Oops.
Milwaukee bike polo pics, yesterday:  (@smutandeggs)
@smutandeggs I was warm riding during bike polo yesterday. @chrisgauger and @svdodge stood on the sidelines to watch; they froze.
@smutandeggs That and being able to bike all winter are good reasons to move somewhere warmer.
@svdodge Soon. Very soon. Probably in the next two weeks.
@whil I will put Hello Kitty stickers on my bike if you can supply them.
@smutandeggs Spokes should let you weave it in there, even with lamination.
@joshjs YOU WILL BE HERALDED IN THE COURT OF THE CYBERKING. ALL HAIL THE CYBERKING.
@schmenzer pressed the headset races into my new frame. Thanks again!
Whoa. Dizzy followed by vertigo. Had to find a place to sit down.
ALL HAIL THE CYBERKING.
OH: "Where's the rest of my SWAT Team? Am I just SWAT Guy?"
@smutandeggs Without any hard stops to my shoulder's motion and socket, the muscles are all that holds my shoulder together.
Test fit the vintage suede Turbo saddle on new bike frame. Painful to sit on. May have to try more seats to find something more comfortable.
@svdodge There's scripts and addons that'll decode it in the status bar or as an alt-text popup. Just have to go grab them.
'Epic' gets so overused now.
@raster The main obstacle is the cost of everything.
Anyone else want to learn to screen print this winter? Or start some screen printing projects? Let me know via DM. Getting setup here soon.
@smutandeggs I don't think my shoulder can take tallbike jousting. Or any jousting. With either arm holding the pole.
Probably the best action shot I got of bike polo yesterday: 
Coffee addict.
Who wants to live forever?
I gotta start training for @cranksgiving. Just because it's an excuse to train.
Discussing steel alloys with @chrisgauger and what goes into Reynolds 531, Chromoly 4130, etc.
@ashedryden On the condition that you and @chrisgauger teach me to cook different types of soup.
@littletinyfish It only really works with a pile of wet leaves.
@littletinyfish Mountain bike with slick tires. Lean forward and kick out the rear.
@gegere Verizon cell phone.
Beautiful day for a Fall bike ride & skidding in leaves. Let's hope Fall doesn't bring a fall, tho.
Modern Polyester-based underarmor-type base layers are great for wicking & warmth, but they smell terrible when you get them sweaty.
Twitter DMs only making it to my cellphone about 20% of the time. Makes having a conversation hard.
OH: We can't compete with that linkjuice.
Just noticed @chrisgauger's slick mountain bike tires have "IRC" printed on the tread. Geeky.
@DAPproducts Vanilla scent? Awesome. Need another tube for the rest of the windows + porch door; will look for your stuff.
@raster What time? &gt;.&gt;
@JoeSteve fixed link for you: 
@Lyndzi I am immune because I refuse to listen to the audio on that video.
Pictures of the Milwaukee Bicycle Collective point out to me how much organizing we need to do. Also, that we need better lighting in there.
@bikeskirt Thanks! :D
@bikeskirt I was so focused on my frame yesterday that I forgot to mention my little blogging project: 
RT @bikeskirt My visit to Milwaukee Bike Collective  such an inspiring place.
@whil You eat food? I just get by on air and rainbows.
@chrisgauger And I did ride around the kitchen. And into the living room. That's where your winter bike is parked now, btw.
@bikeskirt Nice to meet you, as well. Hope you're enjoying your stay in Milwaukee :)
@gregtarnoff I successfully parsed that sentence. I am such a nerd. Also, yeah, I saw it. Impressive. (Konami code, not just Contra BTW)
@svdodge Just press 'C' 3 times (Chaos Computer Club) har har har..
@narkalant @qnonymous  thought you might be into it.
So there's a new hacker space in Seattle, and they "have a vending machine that dispenses M&Ms, Clif Bars" AND "Arduinos, breadboards, etc."
Bike build progress as of right-this-now:  & compared to @chrisgauger's Specialized Langster Tokyo: 
@svdodge RC servo motor driven by PWM pulses from an Arduino, controlled from the PC/Mac by Processing. Would work, be simple.
@schmenzer I ride a plastic Selle San Marco saddle on my Miyata. Dunno why a padded Turbo is uncomfortable; shape is nearly identical.
Liberally applying "removable weatherstrip" caulk to the big livingroom window & other leaky doors+windows.
@svdodge I'm thoroughly impressed by your stable. And by stable I mean bicycle collection.
@svdodge Isn't your Merckx your Monday bike? (by way of alphabetization) What are you going to ride on Mondays then? A Moots?
I've got the old Nickelodeon channel jingle stuck in my head. Weird.
@raster put a time lapse camera on an oscillating fan.
@svdodge Sure, if you've got a Selle Italia Flite in white to trade for it.
@smutandeggs I wish I were as tough as a hockey player, but I'm not.
It is nights like this that one wishes to have Mathematica solve everything for you. Or at least wish I had a copy to check answers against.
Can't factor this damned polynomial, and that's the only strategy I have to simplify this. Damn.
Late night of integrating ahead of me. No time for studying, just jumping right in. Here a sign error or exponent error will ruin me. Tired.
So, that didn't go well.
Interesting. Got an email from Speakeasy. Hoping to resolve the situation quickly.
I'm up to 1 hour, 9 minutes on hold. Glad I had the foresight to plug my cellphone into the charger.
Evernote's client app doesn't run on OSX 10.4. Fail.
@gregtarnoff Chucks just don't have the arch support that I need.
Meanwhile my cellphone minutes are getting eaten up.
You'd think they'd be a little quicker to take my money.
47 minutes in, still on hold with Speakeasy. Trying to PAY the final balance & ensure they don't try to autorenew my contract or other BS.
@gregtarnoff I've been wearing synthetic leather trail runners for the past year. Thinking I may have to settle for a similar non-vegan shoe
@gregtarnoff They apparently fall apart and don't have any arch support. Both deal-killers for me. I'm hard on my shoes and need extra arch.
Oh cool, recycled AND vegan sneakers that use car+bike tires for the sole: 
All my batteries are dead.
@gregtarnoff But it is both an issue of people not knowing, and people not caring. At least the vast majority.
@gregtarnoff Not much to be done, with the way drugs are created & approved, getting animal-free variants would be nearly impossible.
@gregtarnoff And flaxseed oil over taking fish oil for Omega 3/6. I may be a little crazy about supplementing in addition to my diet, tho.
@gregtarnoff It isn't medicine, but I get veggie, gelatin-free vitamins from: 
@gregtarnoff I am waiting until things wear out & then replace with a vegan version, yeah. 1 pair of shoes left. Leather is terrible.
@whil I had to factor a polynomial in a denominator so I could integrate it. Then couldn't solve for the constants. Finally solved it at 2AM
@alexfalkenberg I ended up rebooting into my Mac's basecamp partition and re-installing my copy of Mathematica from my last school.
@gregtarnoff Do you not wear wool? Curious.
This elevator smells like a lockerroom.
@raster serial port to relay to a shutter, I mean.
@raster The Newton really doesn't have a way to control a camera. Unless we hack some sort of serial relay to shutter control.
Free Plans To Build your own Bicycle Generator Pedal Power Station 
@raster I set up my D7 site locally at BarCamp during Drupal 102. It just isn't live yet. Debating the design.
Finally home and out of the rain.
I'd honestly take snow over this freezing rain. Soggy & cold. I'll be soaked waiting for the bus later, too.
And if I were really tricky & didn't mind mounting it to an altoids tin, I could power it with a USB-rechargable mintyboost
I could probably make these $6 LED flashlights from Bliffert be a flashing light with a 555 timer chip (cheapest IC out there) easily
I also have a few other projects I could start: hacking @chrisgauger's portable DVD player into a kitchen computer; Arduino weatherstation.
MilwaukeeDevHouse4 peeps! Vote on what I hack on MKEDH4: OpenSprints (Arduino+Ruby+bikes), my Drupal 7 portfolio site, or upgrade my Newton?
Bliffert Hardware sells 9-LED flashlights for $6 that I'd wager are 10x brighter than @ashedryden's LED bike light. Finally found mine again
@rockmanac Make a Google Voice account and give them that number. Let the voicemail fill up and check periodically.
The more I see videos with guys in Southern California riding bikes in yshirts and shorts with slip-on shoes, the more I hate winter.
@JoeSteve Yeah. I'll be there and donating canned goods. Need to do a quick tune-up on my MTB 1st. Heavy bike to ride to Bay View & back.
@whil It may need to be adjusted, or you may need a new seat. Adjustment is the cheaper option to try first.
@whil What's wrong with your seat?
@corbenfrost @Giania Since wisdom teeth extraction get stitches, I'm not sure that is an issue. It just really hurts for about a week.
@whil I've got a CyclOps fluid rear wheel trainer as well, but I want to get rollers at some point. That, and build an OpenSprints system.
@whil The whole idea ion rollers is to improve form so that you ride w/o wobbling, & your effort becomes more efficient. So I've heard.
Debating riding in Biketoberfest. Who is going? Not really my thing to support the "bike culture -&gt; drinking" idea.
Another song for your mornings: 
Another day, another round of integrating functions. 
@whil Do you train indoors during the winter on rollers or a fluid rear-wheel trainer, or something else?
@blissdev Congrats on the MBP!
RT @lockedcog: im going to be giving away some shirts real soon. To win retweet this, and you have to be following me too duh. @lockedcog
Issue resolved. Speakeasy went above and beyond, both in tracking me down and resolving my issue. I am humbled & have to say, thank you :)
@raster I would say to build a new battery pack that packs the same voltage with more mAh. Use a cable to connect it to the camcorder.
@raster  Something here may help. Dunno.
I keep thinking it is Friday. But it is Thurs. 2 tests down, 1 test tomorrow. Paper due on Monday. Hoping to fit in Biketoberfest. Bring it.
Canhaz Journey as tonight's soundtrack plz?
Eating an apple. Waiting.
@whil I didn't finish the Baroque Cycle yet.
@whil Did you read Anathem?
I need a long bike ride and then a long nap.
I like the timelapse scenes & riding traffic in Macaframa, but the cuts between action aren't fast enough (compared to MASHSF), so it drags.
Spinning on the trainer before my test barefoot on plastic MTB pedals is a good way to wake up. History test in a bit.
Why now?
@whil I read everything by William Gibson.
Yay prototypes.
@whil Man, I love Snow Crash. I could talk about Snow Crash for hours. Technically, I had a graduate level class on cyberpunk lit.
@sixohsix git-scm+Eventide Harmonizer. Audio FX processor being equated to git-scm? I think I got that. Dunno what it'd be as guitar pedals.
@whil Cub Scouts rubber-band rockets?
@blissdev mkv's are weird, in VLC & in general. I had one where I couldn't drag the time around. It would just restart from beginning.
This just in: weird aching where I used to have my wisdom teeth. Sympathetic for @ashedryden's pain? That or a sinus thingie.
BikeSnobNYC is making fun of this Dr. Seuss green eggs & ham bike, but I dig it. 
@raster I remember when the battery died on my parent's camcorder, there was no reviving it & (pre-internet) no way to order a new one.
Somehow my tumblr has a tumblarity of 26 & MKEBikeSpotting is at 6. MKEBikeSpotting has queued posts every 12 hours & more followers. Weird.
Avatar: done judging you. Now looking to the future. Or something.
Yay another social network to add all my fronz to.
So, like, foursquare.com in Milwaukee. Woo.
Need to get some coffee and get outside.
None of us are getting any younger, here.
Feel sick. Trying to sleep.
1K Direct Messages in inbox since Twitter started counting. Inbox zero -- inbox schmero.
Biking for a couple hours with some awesome people. Win.
@whil Maybe next week then ;)
@chrisgauger ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL.
@MarcLyon It is super nice out today. Come out for the Mondays in Milwaukee Ride at 6PM :D
@schmenzer Yeah, going to be on-road and probably riding in traffic while it is dark (lights, etc)
@whil You wanna come along?
Trying new green tea. Cranberry-clove flavored. Not liking it, so much.
RT @mkebikespotting: Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride tonight,6pm outside Cafe Hollander. Will return to cafe by 8. Bring your friends!
@littletinyfish @jeffmke @svdodge  @schmenzer 6pm outside Cafe Hollander for the ride tonight.
I'm thinking either Comet or Fuel Cafe may work too. Depends on where people are coming from.
Need to move the Mondays-in-Milwaukee meeting place to a slightly less windy spot than the lakefront. So far, 1 vote for Cafe Hollander.
Keep sneezing due to allergies while we talk about the Louisiana Purchase in class. Doh.
When did non-leather (aka Vegan) shoes get defined as "ugly" ?
@whil Longer than your patience.
M83 - Safe. Love the piano.
Started IMing @cheshster about Cory Doctorow's new book and now our conversation has become "the Spook Country ending is a deflated balloon"
I'm tired. My body knows it is tired. My brain is tired. Just hope I can fall asleep.
Me: "There's no rain until 9. Wanna get up at 8 and ride bikes?" @chrisgauger: "8 /AM/?"
@smutandeggs What kind of fish?
Picture from the ride tonight:  @littletinyfish, @schmenzer, @jeffmke, @svdodge.
Looks like it is gonna be a movie w/ @chrisgauger + working on Calculus while dinner cooks (quinoa and brown rice, veggies, yay! I'm boring)
@svdodge Good deal. I doubled my total monthly mileage today for October. I need to get out more. Weather & class are conspiring against me.
Rough Google Earth estimate is 23 miles for the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride tonight. Plus whatever it took you to get to Cafe Hollander.
Jazzed that we had so many people out for the Mondays-in-Milwaukee ride tonight. We're gonna keep riding through the winter, because we can.
@whil tonight was tshirt and jeans weather, honestly. I overdressed & ended up packing around way too much stuff in my bag the entire ride.
MiM ride went down to St. Francis & on our way back now. Stopping at the artesian well in Bayview.
Painfully long explanation of what radians & pi are tonight in class.
I have serious doubts about my fitness level after last night, and @cranksgiving isn't that far away. Hmm.
Wish they'd done the whole case on the new unibody plastic Macbook in the grippy rubberized bottom plate material. Glossy = fail.
I haven't decided if I want to go with track pedals + toeclips & straps, or BMX platform pedals with Chicago Wig Street Straps. Hmm.
Home-made veggie burgers with slices of avacado for dinner. Grilled the whole sandwich on the panini press even. Tasty!
Starting "The Coalition Against Terrible Music in Online Videos"
Think i may try to squeeze in an easy ride with @chrisgauger this afternoon to loosen my legs up, after yesterday.
@smutandeggs Man, when is evolution gonna let those fish out of beta and do a proper release. Almost as bad as a Google product. Har har har

@svdodge I follow Cozy Beehive, yeah. It had some neat posts on bike stability and fork rake.
Tried to get a cellphone pic of one of the Breakaway guys riding/working in the rain, but the shutter was too slow.
@corbenfrost Do you have, like, old books? And stuff?
Put the old mountain bike SPD clipless pedals on the trainer bike. Highly-durable Specialized MTB shoes still look brand new. Spinning.

@margesmith56 @ashedryden Rich Germans demand higher taxes 
OH: "Where is my body?"
Cancelling the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride for tonight on account of the rain and my general exhaustion level. Sorry.
CRT Monitor for the Milwaukee Bike Collective acquired. Huzzah. Weds I should be able to bring a whole computer to use at the Collective.
Sprinting in 45 degree weather is a lot harder than in 85 degree weather. I miss the summer; getting my ass kicked by this cold weather.
Biking up to Brown Deer Park with @chrisgauger to take advantage of this weather. Still exhausted.
Wishing I could trade yesterday's weather for today. Can't go for a ride tonight, I've got class until 8:30PM. Grr.

@whil Are you really coming out? It'd be good to catch up post-BarCamp.
Watching 300 with @chrisgauger. Fuck Yeah, Sparta.
Plans for tonight arranged. Heading to the @tappsestate Halloween Party. Now to make a costume last-minute.
Finally got myself together and got a lb of coffee beans from Alterra. Today still hasn't started, and yet there's trick-or-treaters outside

Hello bright sun. Does your presence mean I was supposed to have slept between now and yesterday?
@whil I have class on Thursday nights, which prevents me from attending. Sorry.
Home, finally.
And we break out the Journey on Rock Band.
The Code Monkey costume is super cute.
OH: "and i have a hammer but it is under his laser gun."
Just revealed that I'm @kevinrose for Halloween.
At the @tappestate.
Hipsters. Everywhere.
Rawr.
@whil I'm going for a subtle costume. We'll see if anyone picks up on it.
Stealing the front wheel off the trainer bike rather than fixing the spokes on my MTB/winter bike. Quicker, easier, win!
@svdodge Yeah. Cafe Hollander, just before 6.
Freezing indoors. Wondering what it is like outside with some wind.
I guess we're riding tonight. DM me if you have ideas.
Anger gets you nothing in life. It's a useless emotion, and one I wish I could get rid of.
Nothing ever happens the way we want it to. Therefore, it is worth developing skills in dealing with the unexpected and coping.

this food is problematic.
This car is the worst minigame puzzle ever.
We got the security system to turn the fuel injectors back on. It's trying to start, but it may be flooded.
@chrisgauger remembered a deleted paragraph in the Oldsmobile Alero wikipedia article. Looked it up, found the fix for the ignition problem.
An online forum of car mechanics agree that Alero's of this vintage have starting issues, and GM's response to "buy a new car." Awesomer.
Pushing @chrisgauger's car all over the parking lot because it won't start. We should have biked for groceries :)

Just went by a condo with a big flatscreen TV in it running the SETI screensaver. Cool!
@JoeSteve It was a tech event. For the weekend itself, we could sleep at the venue. But I drove there on Fri night & can't remember a hotel.
Weird black hole in memory. Can remember very specific details about driving to the Twin Cities for an event in 2008 but not where I stayed.
@svdodge Can't get out until at least 9PM and I've got a borked front wheel that I should be working on right now. I'll let you know?
@offwhitemke Didn't you have Comet for breakfast? That said, I approve, and yes, it is much quieter AND quicker service in the afternoon.
@riverwest Could you use this data to do time-of-day histograms?
@riverwest 2009 has been busy.

@whil Tried merino wool?
@whil 40 degrees is warm enough for tshirts and jeans, if you push yourself hard enough.
Man, we should do a V for Vendetta ride tonight.
@LukeStory Awesome mug and awesome French Press. I need to go on an Alterra shopping spree..

riding clipless for the first time in forever; borrowing @chrisgauger's mountain bike.
@littletinyfish Spokes are tight now, but I've skewed it enough to make it hit the brake in one spot. Truing isn't easy.
@fragmad Sounds like the "Mexican Spice Latte" they make here at a coffee chain called Stone Creek, except missing the espresso.
Anyone have links to truing/tightening spokes on a wheel without a truing stand or a fork? Spinning in my hands is kind of low precision.
@fragmad Spicy?!
You can get a track bike frame anywhere nowadays. The question is, can you ride it fast on a track? :P
Octogenarians have the coolest word for their age bracket.
@littletinyfish @svdodge Need to get a sealed English BB, a stem, a cog, and a chain. Oh, and maybe brakes.
It is weird to walk on the sidewalk when i'm so used to biking in the street.

A good first step would be if my login session didn't time out before the server was able to return results to me. Baby steps, of course.
@KeVroN This is actually MATC's server. But I bet most colleges get hit. AWS could probably help, but bureaucracy would stop its adoption.
Hours and hours later, their server is still overloaded, and my continued attempts to register for classes is still unfinished. Gaaaah.

@cranksgiving Just ordered a few more parts to finish my bike. Hoping to get it all put together in time!
Online registration server seems overloaded. Lovely.
Registering for classes for the spring. Which really means rolling the dice and hoping I can get a few things I'd like.

@jeffmke @smashd @svdodge @littletinyfish Thanks for coming out tonight!
@smutandeggs We had one lady with us tonight, actually. I use 'guys' genderlessly.
You guys have no idea how pleased I am that 6 guys besides myself & @chrisgauger showed up for the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride.
Let's see how many tweets one night at class (5:30PM-8:15PM) counts for.
@Arlen Not kids. Telemarketer autodialers. Same principle, different purpose.
@svdodge My (toasted) pb&j sandwhich took me 3 tweets.
@ashedryden It's called the unfollow button and it's right over there on everyone's profiles -&gt;
Riding indoors even though it is nice out. Don't have enough time for a proper ride tonight. Dinner shortly.
Adjusted trainer bike. Shifts into the big ring better now.
@svdodge When we first had Facebook at UWP, there was an Oregon Trail group & I made people's Position one of the ways to die in the game.

Receruiting for @Cranksgiving in calc2.
Home faster than you can say Chequamegon. Bottom bracket fits perfectly.
Ben's Cycle had exactly what I needed. I can start building up my new bike tonight. Excited.
Eh, maybe I'll just run it. Problem is, I don't think the parts are getting here tonight. If I had a BB, I could put that in & put cranks on
@raster @offwhitemke H1N1
@JoeSteve Don't have it yet, so I can't really say for certain.
@JoeSteve Too wide, yeah.
@svdodge I'll probably be able to use it on my Miyata conversion though, if the threading is right.
@svdodge Manufacturer said 68x103-107mm, I ordered a 68x117mm BB. Too wide = chainring out too far, by 1cm. Chainline won't line up.
@littletinyfish confirmed that I ordered the wrong bottom bracket. Whee.
Every loud rumble brings the hope that it's a delivery truck full of bike parts for me.
Just harvested 3+ big bowls worth of lettuce from my porch. Hasn't frosted yet, but this is definitely the last week it would have survived.
Feeling a little better. Heading in for class #2 of the day.
@svdodge I moved my computer about a foot right on my desk. #computinginthesun
@offwhitemke You can pick and choose which open source firmware (OpenWRT, Tomato, etc) to run on the Netgear. Then you can enable QoS.
@offwhitemke I really loved my Netgear 614L. Gave it to my parents when our cable modem (Motorola, boo hiss) came with wifi AP.
@offwhitemke WRT54GL cheaper: 
Would love to feel better right now.
Yes, my towel would be the one with the bike grease on it. Heh.
@blissdev Definitely a clean site. Running on blogger, I imagine?
Ugh. Fail.
Going to the Bike Collective tonight at 8PM. Hoping someone volunteers to open earlier. Hoping FedEx brings bike parts today, too.
@Giania Someone said the other day that they wanted to be a stay-at-home dad without kids. You two should work something out.
I don't think that was sleep. That was just pretending to sleep and being sore.
@ashedryden I already had enough, thanks.
@ashedryden vegetables are vegan, generally, yes. #CaptainObvious
@smutandeggs Didn't know they still made it. Completely different factories, they may have even sold off the brand in the US? Not sure.
Class was 77 tweets long.
@smutandeggs Because they were made in the 70's & sold in both the US and the UK. More 'surviving' Raleigh Shopper/Twenty's may be in the UK
@JoeSteve (as part of receiving your benefits)
@JoeSteve And only if you report that you're looking for work through the unemployment office?
@raster I like how you've upgraded from carrying a 7" eeePC around to tech events to toting a 22" iMac (24"? hard to tell from the side)
@ashedryden I didn't apply because there were no benefits for me. I'm sure a lot of unemployment goes unreported that way.
@Arlen I like the sound of Project Aikido. Write a book, start a conference tour, and charge the big money to teach it to companies.
@FedexDolores @FedexAl I don't have a tracking number, but thank you.
@Arlen But I don't really have enough similar projects or consistent work to do that with.
@Arlen The more data points, the better your prediction. I'd like to try to DIY Joel Spolsky's Monte Carlo method 
Verizon's unlimited data plan for the HTC Droid Eris (and other smartphones, I think) is $45. AT&T's unlimited data for iPhone is $30. Huh.
Landlord is paying for plastic wrapping the windows. He has a company here checking the units for energy efficiency. Glad he's a nice guy!
Trying to be patient for the FedEx guy.
This particular problem is proving to be really hard to prove. #calculus #whee
Off to another exciting round of Physics class. Will miss Web414 because of class, again.
Buying tubes at crankdaddies because we were just at Comet
Hipster whitebeard professor wears his keys on a carabiner on his back belt loop. Has to be at least 60. I bet he listens to Girl Talk. Hah.
Waiting at MATC for class. Have bikes on the brain. Hoping to finish building my bike this afternoon.
@rockmanac The solution there is to never use Exchange.
So yeah. There's no packages anywhere. Whee. #ihavenobikestoridetomorrow
@ashedryden MASSES BLUE SESS
@jephjacques congrats! when can we (the internet) come over?
@FedexAl Hi, just following up. Sent an email this morning to fedex-al@fedex.com and wondering if it was possible to track down my package?
Leonid meteor shower next Tuesday at the UWM Planetarium. Sadly, I can't make it. Hrm.
Milwaukee makes some quality sounds - 
@cjibo No dice. They want your taxes, apparently. Oh, and a blood sample too. I keed.
@cjibo "If you are not a City of Milwaukee resident, please do not fill this form out."
@cjibo You need a license sticker, a bike serial number, and your contact information to fill out this form: 
Licensed my new bike with the City of Milwaukee online. Wheee. Legit.
@jeffmke Had I known you were across the street from where I was waiting for the 15, I would've come over to @AJBombers.
Suspect my package may have been stolen off the downstairs unit's porch. Don't even know what I do if that is the case.
Walking home through Riverwest from the East Library. Beautiful day out. Perfect for a ride, I think.
At the East Library
Walking around downtown.
Need bike parts plz.
Hit with inspiration to take on a new project, after talking to @blissdev. Feels good to be inspired.
At the pick n save on 35th str for @cranksgiving
I finished my bike thanks to @schmenzer and his shop. Thanks again!
Bike's almost finishedn
I love Thai Kitchen's yellow curry. That is all.
Really would like to try Cyclocross. But it is already late in the year & I'm broke. Imagine the GF would say I have too many bikes, too.
@JoeSteve Drop bar coat racks. I need one. And a cruiser-seat bench.
"You see that? Tokyo Drift!" "I am very impressed by your shopping cart handling."
@Cranksgiving If you guys get links to photos (flickr, facebook, etc) we'd love to link to them on  :)
@jeffmke Thinking Monday may be a recovery ride. Although I still wanna hit about 20 miles total. Just taking it easy.
@jeffmke Yeah, you should've done @Cranksgiving last night ;)
@svdodge I'll be building some sort of strength fast at this gear ratio. 46/15t is 80.2 gear-inches, and 52/16t (yours) is 85.0 gear-inches.
@svdodge I'm tired from riding around Riverwest with @chrisgauger, too. (~4 miles) & I'm not in nearly the shape for endurance that you are.
Loving my @EighthInch bike. Rode it for literally the 1st time in @Cranksgiving. (other than 1/2 block to the start line) Turned out great!
Pulling wheelies & bunny hops in the playground in Estabrook Park.
Tightened all the bolts on my new bike & reset the headset bearing tension. Going for a ride with @chrisgauger.
@smutandeggs cold pizza for breakfast = win! ;)
@svdodge Congrats on the opensprints as well :)
Also thanks to @ashedryden @svdodge @littletinyfish @joesteve @smashd @schmenzer & @smutandeggs for being awesome!
Thanks again to @Cranksgiving, @EighthInch for last night.
@whil I'll ride all winter!
I figure I placed 6th since @littletinyfish placed 3rd last night in @Cranksgiving MKE's B Race. @svdodge 5th, @joesteve 4th. Go team!
Living to fight (ride) another day! Not evenl the various train tracks in Bay View can stop me!
Highlights of @cranksgiving: Cyclocross carry running across 27th street into oncoming traffic.
Morning world. Working on a paper.
@jennaddenda @tapps Fairly certain they only allow so many free per year, and I know she's used those.
Frustration.
@smutandeggs You could have your tumblr automatically import your Flickr account.
@jeffmke Do you drink coffee? Thinking about bringing a thermos along in addition to a bottle of water, now that it is getting colder ;)
At Cafe Hollander. Waiting for people to show up. @chrisgauger & @smashd in attendance so far. #mondaysinmilwaukeeride
@svdodge I'm wrapping my bullbars. ;)
Freezing in my apartment. Yay.
@Giania Free acct: old photos stay, they just disappear off your photostream. If you ever go paid, they come back (never deleted off server)
@littletinyfish Adding it to ning and making a group.
RT @GreatDismal / RT @ellouis: "A faintly glimmering radio station." Cake - Frank Sinatra : 
Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride tonight, 6pm outside of Cafe Hollander. Easy 15 miles or so. Dress warm, lights/helmet & bring money for burritos.
Cue half hour discussion  on the Packer game before class can begin.
Pretty sure the guy behind me in line printed his job on my card swipe. Don't want to be paying for other people's printing.
The "6 new tweets" on Twitter.com while I go through my tabs is highly addicting to click and check.
@smutandeggs FlickrUploadr is the best! It'll let you add them all to a set you're creating and you can just let it upload and walk away.
It's been so quiet for the past hour or so. Is this what mornings are like? I've forgotten.
@svdodge Really dig the soft light / soft background:  #notaphotographerstill
@svdodge Maybe the Reservoir Park on North Ave at dusk with downtown's lights behind it, and some sort of flash overhead for the bike? Dunno
@littletinyfish My bike isn't going on FGG. They'd complain about the chainline and chain tension, which are perfect :P
@svdodge Indeed. Although if there's a snow day w/ sun, it'd be kind of neat to do a city/urban backdrop, imho #notaphotographer
The flu shot. It burns now, 32 minutes post puncture.
@svdodge I would def appreciate some sweet photos. My indoor night shots never come out nice & I don't even have a blank wall for backdrop.
Exhausted. Someone run a backup of my brain before I lose it.
@jennaddenda Broken CSS? I noticed it on people's profiles. Visible numbered lists, links aren't positioned correctly or styled.
Motion sick from trying to read on the bus. Whoa. That hasn't happened before.
Also: being up all night for a meteor shower is awesome and educational, so I'd like to get more time for tests on account of lack of sleep.
So, my professors thought it'd be awesome to add take-home tests to in-class tests, on nights I have night class, while paper due dates loom
@LukeStory Riverwest Coop on Clarke. Best tacos in town, isallimsayin'.
@EighthInch Protip: Link the image in the latest blog post to the Flickr image page:  ;)
Backlog of tweets from 4AM: NASA should do space garbage meteor showers, building camera stepper motor, skylights that light up on equinox.
I'm in the first pic with my new bike: RT @EighthInch: MKE Cranksgiving: 
@jeffmke Best wishes, dude.
@svdodge I didn't know you wanted to try my bike. You should've said something!
In Mequon for the meteor shower with @ashedryden & @svdodge
So the breaker blew tonight because our guest plugged a contraband eletric space heater in & left it running. That was fun to fix at 2:30AM.
The heat doesn't work. Tried to reboot the furnace, as it were, but the fan just stays on blowing cold air. Giving up. I just want to sleep.
New game: @chrisgauger & I ride our fixies around the apartment barefoot.
Yum! Guanajuato gets veggie burritos right: huge, with rice & beans, lettuce, tomatos and avacado.
At Guanajuato Mexican Restaurant in Bay View for burritos & some recovery time during the #mondaysinmilwaukeeride. 7 people tonight!
Dear Streets of Milwaukee: Thanks for all the grime I just cleaned off my bike, as well as slightly out of true wheels. 50 miles on new bike
So yeah. I can RT now on twitter.com FEAR ME.
RT @trodrigues: depois de uma barrigada de japonês ontem descobri que tenho um chinês muito bom e baratíssimo a poucos metros de casa. c ...
@jeffmke What kind of tires are on your Kona? I remember slick centers w/ lugged shoulders. Thinking about cyclocross tires for winter.
@svdodge I'll probably get the @EighthInch gold track drops & some white track grips. Next summer, trip down to Kenosha's Velodrome?
@littletinyfish I always thought gold drop bars looked classy.
@EighthInch @lockedcog What do you guys recommend as shoes for riding toeclips? Without going with limited editions of Onitsuka Tigers, etc.
Wondering if i'll have the energy to spin on the trainer for an hour or two after I get home.
The art of dropping all that does not matter.
First time able to try to sleep before midnight in awhile.
@littletinyfish I'll try to make it after class before 9.
@svdodge If pulling very low wheelies counts, then yes. I only have the right shoulder strength for 1-2" wheelie, without a bump to launch.
@littletinyfish I spent some quality time adjusting my brakes tonight and found the front rim to be off a tiny bit. Nothing Miyata-scale.
@JoeSteve Tessa rims would certainly be a nice upgrade.
@JoeSteve Alex 540s
Cleaning my stove. Excitement!
Potential band name: Diffy Q & The Integrals.
Cinelli outdid me on the all-white bike: 
Potential band name: Marriage on a Horseless Carriage.
My new office lacks a computer. But at least I have a motivational poster on the wall & a map of Ozaukee County.
Lockring was finger-turn loose. That's not good. Part of the reason I'm checking everything for tightness today.
For Chicago peeps: RT @Chicago_Reader: Free bike headlights at Milwaukee/Damen/North tonight from 5-7 
@svdodge Cleaning the apartment while laundry runs, then I'll clean my bike, then I'll clean me (shower)
@svdodge How did you know about the goose poop? Oh well, my white tires now match my green handlebars &gt;.&lt;
Home. Bike and I are covered in mud. I love rainy autumns ;)
@svdodge Sorry to have missed you. Circled Lake State Park and came home on the Oak Leaf after getting covered in mud by the kite store.
Front rim isnt very stable laterally around the turns. Thought i'd flatted, but tire is fine. Hub/axle are tight. Loose spokes?
Almost no one walking or riding the lakefront today. Warm and no wind.
Riverwest smells like spoiled milk & small engine exhaust today.
@raster Nope, site is new to me. Thanks.
@littletinyfish At 46x15t. Dunno if I should go to 42x15t or 46x18t.
@littletinyfish Smaller.
Thinking my gear ratio is way off from what it should be for MKE.
@raster and the more variety the better :)
@raster Putting together a nice archive of Milwaukee-made music in case we do any videos documenting the MiM Ride or MKE Bike Collective.
@Narkalant on stage foam sword fights during guitar solos.
@raster It is history class. At least for 10 more minutes. Laptop is for taking 'notes' ;)
@Narkalant LARPcore needs to happen.
@Narkalant Oh cool. I have /just/ the outfit.
Listening to @raster's old bands' mp3s rather than doing something productive.
@raster I like Three Little Figs.
@raster Potential @raster band name: The Wilhelm Scream Campaign.
Potential fairytale band name: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Potential fairytale band name: Goldilocks And The Three Bears.
Potential fairytale band name: Chicken Little and the Falling Skies.
Potential fairytale band name: Humpty Dumpty and All the King's Men.
Potential fairytale band name: Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolves.
@svdodge My family's thoughts and prayers go out to yours.
@abraham Which netbooks are you looking at?
@fragmad Nice!
@littletinyfish Sorry that I missed it. Class ran over to 8:45, was exhausted,  just wanted to bike home and eat dinner.
I'm back to looking for new shoes. High arch support, hopefully vegan (read: synthetic), fit in toe clips are my current requirements.
@fragmad Ravelry and Etsy are better places for that kind of thing. If you want to pass that info along.
Getting interviewed for an ethnographic study of the mke bike collective.
Some guy just did a nonironic "Say hi to your mother for me."
I'm all Martha Stewart up in this hizzy.
Sure
@ashedryden Economics and game theory have better methods of modeling that than performance reviews :P
@Arlen PHP4 or 5?
@Arlen Libraries that you instantiate in order to call its one method (never storing data or persisting) is very Java & sometimes annoying.
@Arlen Someone didn't pay attention in Object Oriented Programming 101.
Skiiiiiiiidz. Also, the Oak Leaf is dark at night. And full of wet leaves. Which leads to.. skiiiiiiiiiiiiidz.
hello world
OH: I want to tweet that, but your mom follows me.
My phone's autosuggest wrote this tweet: Sometimes the guy just did a wheel and it since he wants to work it since he wants to work it since
Leaving Riverwest, riding out to miller park area with @chrisgauger. nice day for riding :)
@chrisgauger just came home with 3 bags of a groceries and a cooler. Fridge and freezer are already packed. woo! food!
The "Milwaukee" tag on Last.fm is lacking, too.
Unimpressed with iTunes Genius and iTunes DJ, tbh.
@chrisgauger ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?
Pretty sure I'm destroying my vintage Selle Italia Turbo saddle. Luckily, I didn't pay the going rate for it. All you haters suck my balls.
RT @mkebikespotting: Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride: tonight 6pm, meet at Cafe Hollander on Downer.
Spokes tightened and wheels brake-trued. Used @chrisgauger's spare rear brake to use as a truing guide. Spokes plink real good now!
@gregtarnoff I've heard the Park Tools blue book and Sutherland's Handbook for Bicycle Mechanics are good starts for books.
@jeffmke Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride tonight, meet on Downer. I won't be in town until 7, will DM you when I get back in town & meet you guys?
@gregtarnoff For fixing a bike, I'd say metric wrench set, metric hex wrenches, tire levers, a patch kit, & lithium grease are a good start.
@gregtarnoff Building bikes or fixing bikes? There's lots of bike-specific tools.  remains the best online reference
Tightening my spokes. Hoping I don't eff up my wheel.
Frustrated by MCTS. Hate walking into class late. Should've taken earlier bus, but I've been waiting nearly a 1/2 hour for this bus already.
@gregtarnoff Winter bikes, taken outdoors, make great bike trainers ;)
@nikulr I gotta do that, too. It looked harder than it should be.
@littletinyfish alt response: Yes, but can she do /bar spins/?
@littletinyfish A gold-anodized water bottle holder?! ;)
@jennaddenda Reh teh teh.
@Arlen My joints don't take jogging nearly as well as biking.
Had a dream that my bike got stolen, including a thief chase scene in the dream. Subconscious is telling me I need to get a better lock &gt;.&lt;
@ashedryden KBAI.
#autosuggest: since he feels better after a Nightmare Before Christmas full sleeve tattoo and it in 5. Will txt you kbai but i'm talking him
I give up at this tweeting this thing this.
Played chicken with a police paddy wagon going about 65mph earlier, full lights & sirens. I was on my bike. Glad I didn't lose.
Really need to get a Nightmare Before Christmas full sleeve tattoo, I just decided.
@joshjs OH: "I'd be in labor too if I was on Facebook." -- @chrisgauger
@jeffmke Go for it ;) 88 miles is nothing, relative to the goal!
@gregtarnoff Accelerando: "he has to assimilate more than a megabyte of text and several gigs of AV content every day just to stay current."
I was at 227 feeds this morning, and that was down from 500+ subscriptions a few months ago. Oh well.
So I unsubscribed from my largest feeds by posting volume: Engadget, NOTCOT.org, and a few others. Still at 250 unread in 175 feeds. Hrm.
@riverwest Disagreeing is fine. I'm saying if it is a speed bump, a hurtle to get through my feeds & onto the rest of my day, then yes.
@svdodge Wow. Just wow. I'm putting you on catchphrase-writing detail until further notice.
@svdodge I'm pretty sure the Madone is equivalent in weight to a switchblade. Just sayin'.
Followup on my mass feed unsubscribing: Why should I /work/ to read my feeds daily? If the feed isn't impressing me, I don't care. Unsubbed!
@svdodge I was thinking we'd just go with a 2010 Madone for each of us.
New rule: If a blog post doesn't wow me or annoys me that it is in my feed reader, I unsubscribe from the feed. No blog is safe.
@svdodge Training, nutrition, and carbon fiber bikes.
@littletinyfish Why do I look ridiculous in every photo? I guess that's just how I am.
@littletinyfish Next alleycat that comes up, I want to get a handlebar-mounted vid cam and carry a point-and-shoot for on-the-move pictures.
@littletinyfish That's my "ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBAL?!" face.
@littletinyfish huzzah. You're on mkebikespotting.tumblr.com ;)
@gregtarnoff @corbenfrost @blissdev I dunno. The first one is good. This one is.. kind of terrible.
Balancing out the Japanese gorefest with a much more realistic movie: Crank 2: High Voltage. Heh.
@jennaddenda did you ever track down Robogeisha?
Watching Samurai Princess with @chrisgauger, a grossout flick like Machine Girl & Tokyo Gore Police.Reminded of @jennaddenda for some reason
@svdodge So I heard!
Setting up the living room for OpenSprints. Did 25 sec sprint on @ashedryden's new trainer & gave seal of approval. @chrisgauger vs me next.
My sinuses have become a river, my nose the estuary. Ew.
@chrisgauger made some awesome enchiladas.
Feeling worn out again.
@blissdev Don't get me wrong. Setting up Wordpress is quite different than compiler theory though, and we already have group for the former.
@blissdev :P
@mariehuynh Wondering if MKE is hurting for a C/C++ "real coders" group. I've heard of Geek Book Clubs before for working through SICP, etc.
@mariehuynh Never got very deep into C, network programming or systems programming. Did a lot of scripting and web app dev. Dunno.
Shared entrance* &gt;.&gt;
There's some shit going down outside by our shared interest. People need to stop arguing. Where is the love?
@mariehuynh I'd like to talk programming some time. Sounds like you're into a lot of stuff that I wanted to learn but never got into?
@EighthInch The number of MKE riders on EighthInch bikes is growing 
@jeffmke I may just have to ride the bus with @chrisgauger and our bikes and have him show me.
@jeffmke I need to learn how to rack'em. Missed the UPAF afterparty (was in the ER), but I know @chrisgauger & @ashedryden learned there.
Coffee + almond milk to warm up after a chilly morning ride. Staring at the leafless trees. Where's that sun thing, anyways?
RT @fragmad: The answer is always more coffee.
@ashedryden Monotasking works well, I hear.

Went riding with @chrisgauger. Saw another @EighthInch locked up on a bike rack on my block. Didn't have my camera so I missed the photo op.
Just realized I can turn off RTs per person on their profile. That's a better option than unfollowing them. Win.
Link reference for previous tweet, via @Lyndzi: 
Trying to figure out why Christian Rap has gunshot sound FX & claim to be 'rough riders' in a song about abstinence. They're so oblivious.
Should've biked to the RW Coop, but i just cleaned my bike this afternoon and it is still really wet out here.

@svdodge We try :)
"What are you doing?" "I'm vacuuming." "But this is the future, we have robots for that now."
Watching The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly with @chrisgauger. Going to try to spin on the trainer the entire way through (3 hrs)
@jennaddenda Did they tear that down? :/
In a doc about girls riding bikes, one girl complained that you can't be fashionable & wear heels. So begins my clipless high heels project!
@web414 needs a list of @web414 folks.
Netflix has Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus on Watch Instantly. Thanksgiving win!
I'm thankful that the sun is out while @ashedryden drives down to Chicago.
@chrisgauger and I are making plans to go bomb the trails along the river on the mountain bikes. Expecting to get wet, cold & muddy. Huzzah.
I think I'll be full for the next 3 days. Time to burn some of it off on the bike trainer.
@svdodge Nice! re:insulation. ;)
@raster 
OH: Space dentist. best show ever.
@joshjs I have that on DVD, should it ever be needed for Bad Movie Nights.
Dear internet: I want to know everything about everything. Let's do this.
@raster Actually that was meant for @manfredmacx.
Coffee make.
OH: "I could probably drink a whole bottle of vodka." "How much do you weigh?" "I weigh more than a bottle of vodka."
OH: The 80s was a very gross decade.
zomg. The Neverending Story and The Neverending Story 2 on Netflix Watch Instantly. Yes, our thanksgiving is rocking.
@chrisgauger & I discussed going on a short night ride. Then we saw weather.com says it is now 37 degrees, 20mph winds, feels like 26. Ouch.
@svdodge I'll wait to let @ashedryden and @chrisgauger chime in more, but it's very similar to the Field Roast-based food at Comet Cafe.
That ride was 233 tweets long.
Back from Cedarburg. Epic ride (take that Bike Snob) with @chrisgauger completed. Roughly 45 miles in total.
OH: "how's the hot chocolate?" "milky."
Cedarburg is really bustling today. Must be that Black Friday thing. Oh, to have disposable income.
Chillaxing at the Cedarburg Out&Out.
Perfect solution to overeating for 2 days of Thanksgiving feasts: @chrisgauger & I rode to Cedarburg on our tarck bikes.
Churning through dishes. Bike ride to Brown Deer Park and beyond as soon as I'm done.
Going to make @ashedryden and @chrisgauger vegan pumpkin pancakes for dinner. Very excited.
@corbenfrost RELoad bags made that one. Lots of companies make similar, yeah.
Still really want this backpack:  But it's a prototype, not-for-sale. Lamesauce :/
Feeling great after a sandwich and a Red Eye coffee at Fuel Cafe with @ashedryden, @lyndzi, @smutandeggs & @toolshedgirl
On Thursday, I tore down the Miyata Six Ten to the frame and cleaned it. In 2010 it'll get reborn as my long-distance geared touring bike.
@whil I'm a hipster, apparently. I only ride in skinny leg Levi's.
I suppose I'll have to get one of the reissues in white synthetic covering (smooth) when this one wears out and needs to be retired.
Really love my /vintage/ Selle Italia Turbo saddle. The suede cover is eating my jeans alive though.

Relaxing on the solar raft, sun-drying krill & firing up the propane grill to roast mutant squid we speared. The post-apocalyptic good life.
@kevron Thanks for gSharing that article on regexes. The Javascript part was totally worth reading, for me.
Monday's weather says mostly cloudy and 32 degrees by the time we'd be out for the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride. Bring it on.

OH: "Do we have any bread left." "No. But you've got me!" "You're not exactly sourdough bread."
I need a pound of coffee, pronto.
It's so cold that both sides of the windshield fogged up.
Nothing is going well.
@jeffmke It's on!
Watching 12 Monkeys with @chrisgauger when I should be writing papers.

@svdodge We're definitely in much better shape than in the Spring. Sprinting 31mph uphill on Clybourn. Hahaha.
That wind! 20mph in your face is nasty on a bike. Nearly got blown over a few times! Home from the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride.
#MiM ride update: rode down to Greenfield Ave then out to 27th. Into the wind the whole way. Stopping at the Mitchell Domes for a second.
We're in Cafe Hollander warming up for the #MiM ride until @svdodge shows up. @smashd @schmenzer etc.
tearing apart my livingroom to unpack my printer and print out a paper.

@raster MOGRAPH sounds like a death metal band.
@brennanMKE Upgrade discs work on everything though.
@svdodge RT @MikeBrenner: The Most Amazing Beard Of All Time - 
@svdodge I'll tag along if I'm back by Bayshore in time; assuming @littletinyfish will enjoy our help.
@petdance Google Quick Search looks interesting. I'll have to check it out.
@ashedryden I'm kicking Belle and Sebastian today. Coincidence?!
mmm soup!
Guy on the bus is playing Bioshock on his 15" mbp. Nice!
Sales-guy-type on Wisconsin was wearing an "I need a job" sandwich board. Wonder how effective that is. He should try monster or Craigslist.
OH: "It'sa Mario. Mario Speedwagon."
Oh: "We're engineering the world's first dry soup."
@svdodge but @chrisgauger and I go through a box of pancake mix quick :)
@svdodge Next time we get a box of pancake mix, I wanna try some of my frozen raspberries.
You know what's not trending and should be? #snow
My vegan pancakes have so many blueberries in them this time. soooo tasty.
@svdodge Some other time then.
@gregtarnoff Get one of these to go over your beard: 
@svdodge If you want to come over, come and get some pancakes. There's plenty.
Home sweet home.
Turn-off: smoking weed on the bus. (Yes. That is happening right now on the 10.)
Turn-off: talking on your cellphone while you're on the john.
Snowflakes in Riverwest, rather #mistweet
Snowflakes in the
Can't find my favorite warm hat. Lame!
One load of dishes done (by hand). Keep thinking it is time to take apart the portable dishwasher and fix its leaks.
@Arlen I try to quit every once and awhile, probably 4-5 times a year.
@Arlen Don't seem to have any withdrawal this time. Not sure why.
3 days without caffeine. That's kind of a record, for me. Trying to keep it up.
my apartment is a mess. joy.
@chrisgauger XBill!
@ashedryden was telling me about a story of a car-bike accident on NPR  now I'm sharing car-bike accident horror stories
@jeffmke Congrats!
Getting into  Very high production quality and interesting topics.
Crossed off my #1 TODO list item from the past 2 months this morning. Whew. In a much better mood.
@jeffmke Go for it!
Back from the bike ride. 30 mins or so. Feet are freezing despite merino wool. Never quite got up to cadence to get warm. Wind was nasty.
And we're off for a bike ride in the sun.
Just learned about @Fixmas_MKE. Who's in? @mathiasx/mondays-in-milwaukee-ride
@tronathon is across the street right now &gt;.&gt;
Had 4 cups of tea. All herbal, no caffeine. Keep drinking more tea, waiting for the caffeine high. Hrm.
@ashedryden I'm in for the mix CD club.
I have now been up for roughly an hour. There's nothing to do. The person's alarm clock downstairs is going off. Should I go back to sleep?
@petdance Try one of those shrink-wrap plastic window kits.
@Arlen This is your brain on work:  (google tech talk I'm watching right now)
@svdodge Plus all the sidewalks and bike lanes are awash in a deep layer of sharp road salt, so it wasn't so fun out there.
@svdodge No matter which way we went, we were into the wind. Couldn't win. Plus stopsign-every-block Riverwest streets tend to slow me down.
@chrisgauger rode off on his bike to return a netflix envelope. I'm too crabby to get outside and on my bike.
Need to get this computer to the MKE Bike Collective and clean up my winter bike. Headache is making it impossible to move, though.
Really bad headache, but need to get things done today. Was suffering through car ride to/from Woodman's & shopping with 8 million sick ppl.
@corbenfrost We really did take in a cat from the cold, but later returned it to its owners.
We kidnapped a cat.
We decided to watch Akira Kurosawa's classic, Yojimbo, instead.
My legs can take the spinning, but my stomach can't. Lame. Cool down and then heating up some soup for dinner.
@whil I'm gonna watch 2 Simpsons episodes on the bike trainer, then talk to @chrisgauger about dinner. Possibly spin thru some Futurama, too
@Arlen Also, dragging around so much Java stuff when you're not developing Java. Don't get me wrong, Eclipse was my IDE when I did Java work
We went for a bike ride. Lake was really calm, no wind. Winter mountain bike has a bent front wheel and is generally slow and heavy, though.
@sixohsix Agreed, but she's not using it for Java development, or even PHP web app development w/ a local server, just editing PHP files.
My laptop doesn't have sound. this is an issue.
@smutandeggs Cool!
BTW, there is no 'best' editor ;)
Had the text editor vs. IDE vs. world argument with @ashedryden. Can't convince her that a powerful text editor &gt; Aptana.
@ashedryden's iTunes library is meticulously organized and classified using the Comments field into decades, moods, etc. Mine is chaos.
Heading out for the Mondays-in-Milwaukee bike ride.
@svdodge I know what you mean. I've taken to wearing my winter coat indoors at MATC and in our own apartment to stay warm.
Anyone else able to come out tonight for the Mondays-in-Milwaukee ride? @svdodge @jeffmke @littletinyfish @smashd @schmenzer ?
@mathiasx/mondays-in-milwaukee-ride Today is Monday, so tonight we ride! Meet at Cafe Hollander on Downer at 6PM. SNOW RIDE!
Barcelona's Absolutes album is becoming a new favorite. 
OH: "Here's to us schmoes working for the man, even if he is a hot sexy female man."
@littletinyfish I need to get some fenders yet.
@ashedryden Say what? 
I came here to differentiate and chew bubblegum, and I'm all outta bubblegum.
@svdodge  Trying to make sense of their pop-up for "	Exception to alt. side night parking" &gt;.&lt;
Those UPS trucks are a lot more quiet than I remember. And we can't hear them knocking on the outside door. They're like delivery ninjas.
Hanging out with a hawk on Humbolt.
@compujeramey SNOWMAGEDDON. If we dare gaze outside, we'll be turned to pillars of ice. (If it were pillars of salt, we could work with it)
Oh well, at least it is new shoes day! Chrome Kursk shoes on a UPS truck somewhere, headed for me! 
@schmenzer Getting them free from friends and family is a good start. I know I've given away a couple bikes to get people hooked.
This tea didn't help.
Terrible mood.
@svdodge At least riding bikes is free. It's the buying and maintaining them that costs money!
Seriously envy @littletinyfish's winter bike. May have to find a better-fitting mountain bike to build up myself in the new year.
I made some really tasty vegan split pea soup. Going to post the recipe to @ashedryden's new vegan recipe tumblr.
OH: "Now you're cooking with portals!"
@smashd We ended up heading home from Silver Spring. Have a great night!
We just got separated from @schmenzer & @smashd in WFB. Trying to play catch-up when we don't know which way they went. heh.
@svdodge Ride cruisers with aero helmets. Sitting upright.
@svdodge I want that helmet. I'd like like a Giger alien from Aliens 
@joshjs @littletinyfish Nah. Just leave the fridge closed. It'll be fine for awhile.
@littletinyfish Power's fine over here on Weil. Weird.
@schmenzer I'm digging your Xtracycle  Looks like a good way to get the kids+sleds to a sled hill tomorrow, too? ;)
@svdodge We should invent the soap box derby of track bike racing, though. Straight shot, steep incline, huge chainrings.
@svdodge I'm guessing (but not sure) that it is a motopaced time trial bike, velodrome-only?
@svdodge @littletinyfish I've found my winter bike. Now just to fit some cyclocross tires on there: 
@svdodge I'm reading my book on Abe Lincoln while spinning on the bike trainer in my new Chrome shoes. I'm plenty warm.
@ashedryden You can tell your techs that as a consolation prize, that I'm rerecording "Bennie and the Jets" as "Ashley and the Techs"
Tired.
Found 2 leaks in the portable dishwasher. Here's a question for DIYers: silicon caulk was tried by prev owner & failed. Best way to seal it?
If anyone's got big sheets of insulating foam, or just plain Styrofoam, I could use some. OK. Off to class now.
@svdodge Probably up to code if they had to replace any.
@svdodge I'm also thinking that the large window in our livingroom (4x6' or so) needs to be turned into a solar heater instead of a window.
@svdodge That's why thermopanes are so awesome. But my apt bldg doesn't have them!
Things I learned in physics 2: Cost to heat a total of 6 square meters of single-pane windows: $2000/month.
Things I learned in physics: Cost to heat a 1600sqft house with no windows or doors and R19 insulation: $85/month
Anyone know of a service that would, say, take the New Scientist & only give me the best (most popular, whatever) posts as an RSS feed?
The heat vents in our apt suck. They're on the ceiling and they blow horizontally, heating our (uninsulated) ceiling but not the room. Lame.
All out of good pens and I have a big Calc2 test today. Hrm.
@JoeSteve @svdodge I'm right in-between you guys at 46t/15t, 80 gear-inches.
@svdodge We'll find you a 13t freewheel from BMXland or something.
I really want to wipe my disk and start with Snow Leopard on a clean slate. But I don't have a means to do a full backup of internal drive.
@Arlen The only reason I own a printer is because some professors refuse to use email or Blackboard (webapp). They're on their way out.
@Arlen Digital records is the way of the future, I hear. No more of this 'paper' stuff. ;)
@EighthInch Those stems look great! Have been considering going to riser bars and a BMX stem, you must've read my mind.
@Arlen Take the top of the desk off.
@svdodge I only go in straight lines anyways!
@svdodge Another frontrunner for my new winter bike: 
The @BikeSnobNYC linked to some primo Dandy Horse riding action in a video (in German) on Hulu: 
I slipped and fell on my right arm this morning. I'm out for the Santa Ride and probably for doing much of anything for a week or so.
@svdodge Both Google Chrome Beta for Mac and Google Quick Search (to replace Quicksilver) both want at least Leopard. I'm on Tiger still.
Thinking about starting a blog|wiki to share the best deals online for merino wool socks, sweaters, etc. Who's in? @svdodge @littletinyfish?
considering installing Snow Leopard on the macmini tonight.
@Narkalant @corbenfrost Thanks. Prev owner put the silicon on the side of seal. My solution: back off screws, get inbtwn there, tighten down
My iPod was fully charged at 5pm. Waiting for 30 minutes in the cold for the bus killed its battery.
@svdodge I dig that track. Going to have to look into them further.
Oh armorgames.com, how enticing you are when I need to actually get stuff done.
So how did the Santa Ride turn out? I want photos.
All the things put off to the weekend are now getting done. But still have 3 papers & a takehome test due Mon, plus two finals to study for.
@corbenfrost Everything is shiny and new.
@antifuchs This was the dvd from Netflix, with English audio and English subtitles. Audio != subtitles for most of what they said.
Hello world. I am on Snow Leopard. And Google Chrome.
This is your future. Live it.
New music to listen to, Twitter, and a backlog of household chores are all conspiring against my papers being written.
My basil plant got a much-needed haircut. Funny how a bunch of other stuff gets done when I need to be writing papers.
Overloading the dishwasher to take advantage of the fact that we now have a working dishwasher. Wondering if it will leak again.
@zacwitte just read AI+quantum computers post you gShared. Does Grover's algorithm mean DBs on quantum computers are going to be awesome?
@blissdev Thought about writing a browser turn-based RPG in Sinatra, inspired by Kingdom of Loathing & nethack. May start that after finals.
@blissdev Are you hosting your project on github?
@blissdev Sinatra is really cool. I imagine it has changed a lot since I last used it a year or so ago, though.
Also, I broke and went and bought a pound of coffee. I keep telling myself it'll help me write better papers. I'm an addict.
Starting 3 papers. Too bad my brain keeps drifting back to writing a blog post (for my nonexistent bike blog) reviewing my new Chrome shoes.
@svdodge Green is useless 99% of the time. But I can count on the red button to work! The yellow button is just there to mistakenly click..
Boredom paralyzing me when I should be working on stuff for class. Gah.
Must.. integrate..
@ashedryden keeps throwing cans of coconut milk down our stairs. It's like the Thai version of Donkey Kong.
@zacwitte I will be done with my classes + finals on Thursday. Totally.
Wait, you built a webapp to model the probability of the Singularity / human-level AI, but it is a Java applet that only works in IE6? #fail
I may have judged the Chrome Kursk shoes worthy too soon. Feet are killing from wearing all day; feels like the sole is too thin/flexible.
My fingers have lost the muscle memory for all of the punctuation and capitalization in my web banking login's password. Erp.
@mathiasx/mondays-in-milwaukee-ride I'm calling the ride off for tonight, on account of the wet and general being busy.
@svdodge I figure it's cold and wet out, and I don't have fenders yet.
Rands In Repose: Gaming the System 
Anyone really want to go on the #MiMRide tonight? @mathiasx/mondays-in-milwaukee-ride I'm busy with finals week & not prepared for weather.
Err. Maybe it was 40 pages. Still. A lot of writing for me.
I wrote over 50 pages in three separate papers this weekend. Managed to complete a take-home test as well on Fri. Pretty pleased with myself
Wake up, write more.
@talktostrangers Congrats!
FACTS. I haz them on my side.
Me: "I dunno if Thomas Jefferson can compete as a statesman with King Leonidas." @ashedryden: "THIS IS MONTICELLO! ... THIS IS TASTY JELLO!"
I am the vegan cookie monster. OM NOM NOM.
Writing prolifically on papers for final assignment to American History (up to Reconstruction).
Potential Band Name: John Adam and the Quasi-War Federalists.
Tonight's dinner was thanksgiving feast 2: the TOFUrduckening.
The bike had lights, btw. My personal opinion is car driver was at fault.
Cyclist on Humbolt got cut off by an oncoming car that turned left in front of cyclist. Cyclist crashed in crosswalk. Made sure he was OK.
@nikulr $689 for Antec Sonata case+PSU, Core2Duo 2.8Ghz, 2gig DDR2 1066, 1TB, 2x8800 GT. Cheaper than macmini if you get rid of a GFX card.
@nikulr Maybe when I need more proc power than the macmini.Start w/ cheap Core 2 Duo & upgrade later. I code stuff & OpenCL looks like fun.
@nikulr Wikipedia says nVidia 8800GT are supported in Snow Leopard for OpenCL. 2x in SLI would be decent and cheap at $99 each from newegg.
@nikulr Have dremel, will hack.
@nikulr Damn. Maybe I'll put one into one of those old graphite G4 towers. Also, he really didn't need one of those EFix firmware cards.
2009 in review: Circuits and Crickets : @ashedryden re: I confess that in 2009 I have: 
@nikulr I have fairly weird dreams. Usually very Kafka-esque.
@lockedcog In your footer, "provide some cool products why we are at it." should be "provide some cool products *while* we are at it." Kthx.
@JoeSteve During slowmo on trainer towards the beginning, I was wondering why he was rocking on rollers, then we see how hard he's cranking!
@JoeSteve Holy shit. That dude is fast.
So, I hurt my lower back today. My shoulders hurt. Damned bag and heavy textbooks. My body is falling apart.
@schmenzer Some won't wear wool but I find it essential. In terms of cruelty, sheep herding is more humane than beef farms or battery cages.
@schmenzer Avoiding leather & being vegan is hard: Still have leather belts & gloves. Gradually phasing it out of my life.
Rough iPod transitions in shuffle mode: Bad Brains to JS Bach to Charlie Christian.
@nikulr I dreamt about testing for convergence at -3. Also about being Tyler Durden and jumping motorcycles over Chevy Trackers. Heh.
I think I have a head cold. During finals week. Ugh. Feeling miserable.
Remember the days when people without profile pics looked like o_O ?
@nikulr Time for math for me, too.
Officially bored. So I'll put on Iron Man loud & ride on the bike trainer
They keep calling Kathy Ireland "big boned" in this movie. I am so confused.
Throw some Cirque de Soleil in there.
This movie seems to be a combination of Beetlejuice + Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome filtered through the Smells Like Teen Spirit video.
@schmenzer And today I read how Macbeth's vegan shoes are decent in toe clips. So hard to find decent vegan shoes 
Oh come on now. My left shoulder hurts. That's not even the broken one. I'm falling apart worse than @whil.
@brennanMKE Iceberg lettuce!
@littletinyfish Was hoping the sole was gonna be stiffer. If it's this soft, it means my pedal is going to be pushing through to my foot.
Quarter to 10 AM. I think I've waited as long as humanly possible before grinding coffee and waking up @chrisgauger. Sorry, @chrisgauger.
Sick. Math final in-class portion part 1 today. Conflict.
Finished the take-home portion of the math final. Formula sheets are all prepared. Second star to the right, and straight on till morning...
@nikulr Yeah. Check it out: 
@3liza Just was exposed to Lady Gaga for the first time, and for some reason I suspect you & @Qnonymous have created her to prank the world.
@svdodge Hmm. Maybe a greasemonkey script?
trying to tweak the comfort level of my Chrome Kursk shoes by switching the insoles with those of other shoes I like. #owmyfeet
RT @cheshster: I think I need to read the new @dresdencodak a few times before I get it. But still! There's a new Dresden Codak \o/
I am quite certain that I have run into @littletinyfish's floppy-mohawked doppelganger on the bus.
Pug on the bus! Pug in a sweater on the bus!
#autosuggest: if I didnt stop then men better be careful with what they say everything north backed up due to an hour of the dead alleycat.
@littletinyfish Kind of sad that I missed the MKE Bike Swap. Oh well. I was broke (and still am) anyways.
Preparing to go do battle with derivatives, integrals, and various series/sequences/conics/etc. The fate of the planet hangs in the balance.
Apparently the asking price on the old Selle Italia Turbo Gel / Turbomatic Gel are $90. Ouch.
I definitely need to find one of these: 
@schmenzer How much weight did the internally geared hub and dynamo hub add to your Steel is Real bike? Just curious, planning stuff out.
Also: Pages.app really screwd up on rendering his Microsoft Word-created notes & diagrams. Wish he'd have distributed them as PDFs. Oh well.
Waiting for the last minute before Physics final to print off all the professor's notes (which we're allowed to use) may have been a mistake
Also, I am thinking the 2010 Project bike should be Iron Man 2-themed. That is all.
For anyone looking to get some rollers for the winter: 
@JoeSteve @svdodge Project for 2010: Bruiser/Thrasher/Dropout frame + fenders + cyclocross tires; test it on local mountain bike trails.
@JoeSteve (because you can fit the wider tires in there)
@JoeSteve Have you seen the Bruisers built up for cyclocross? I wonder how a trick frame would work as commuter with off-road capabilities.
@JoeSteve I feel the same. I like doing wheelies & bunny hops, but going fast in a straight line or in traffic is more fun, personally.
Paper jam! damnit.
This is my Dock.app now. 
The macmini is stuck showing a black screen, and won't wake properly from sleep, either. Minorly annoying. Can't even VNC in. REBOOT!
Google Quick Search is a Google replacement for both Quicksilver and Google Desktop, under development:
Google Docs plugin for Google Quick Search needs more functionality, like "Create new [doc|spreadsheet]" Only can search your existing docs.
@svdodge Maybe we can put Mattracks on the buses. 
Did my Calc2 final in 30 minutes. 45 problems, and I double-checked everything. I'm glad in math that stimulants(coffee) are allowed :)
Alt idea: VW makes an electric AWD Rabbit with the Toureg's amazing AWD control systen.
#randomIDEAthursday: nissan should buy subaru and make an all wheel drive electric car (electric-motor-per-wheel) that's good in the snow.
@Lyndzi I've been sick for the past week, but I hide it well.
@ashedryden and @chrisgauger are convinced that I'm a walking bioweapon, and that I have purposely made myself sick to spite them.
Reading about lowering the minimum wage on Marginal Revolution. My question: what would happen if businesses couldn't cut wages? Layoffs?
Trying to figure out how I'm going to budget enough credit-hours get this certificate in the next 4 years.
@cheshster I'm guessing they don't have all the climbing spots in one area in the UK. In which case, he needs to move to Utah or Colorado.
@fragmad Bicycle!
@Narkalant Much appreciated. Didn't have a web connection handy to google for immediate questions when I DMed you.
@fragmad I am guessing that your driving test is much harder than ours, or you just don't have the practice?
Fuck Yeah: Iron Man 2 trailer. Go watch it in HD! 
@gregtarnoff btw, something I've been thinking about lately:
@nikulr That test was scary in how easy it was. I felt like I'd missed a whole page of it after I left.
@gregtarnoff I think the police horses are a sort of symbol of police presence. But we don't have Wild West horse chases or Cavalry anymore.
@gregtarnoff And zoos are cruel, in my personal opinion. But there's edge cases, where endangered species are bred back to sustainable #'s
@gregtarnoff True. I'm torn over the use of horses for police beats here in MKE.
@gregtarnoff There's certainly cases where animals are abused, like that link. I think that is a per-person, not every person, problem tho.
@gregtarnoff In most cases I do not believe it is more humane to free a domesticated animal. Their exposure to us domesticated them.
@gregtarnoff  Take horses. We couldn't release them here; we're rapidly running out of free open space in the US. Ship them all to Mongolia?
@gregtarnoff "We taught this lion to eat tofu..." -- Futurama.
OH: When that Transformer transforms, it punches Matt in the face!
@smutandeggs It's Tumblarity inflation! Run for the hills! Get your Tumblarity out of the bank now before everyone else makes a run on it!
OH: "Hell hath no fury like the vast robot army of a woman scorned."
@svdodge Yeah, we should. My schedule is a lot more open with classes over. Now we have to wait for some sun?
@svdodge Probably no racks in parking ramps, but that's worth adding to amend the bill that requires new businesses to put up racks.
@mtbvegan I like seitan. We keep meaning to make our own on the weekends but run out of free time. Yes, we're that busy, usually.
@LukeStory Yeah. I saw your dining room back in October Just need a workbench and a couple bike stands in there! Oh, and a paint booth!
Neat side-effect of having reverse-osmosis filtered water: our ice cubes are nearly perfectly clear.
Discussing vegan cooking and the merits of Field Roast at the Riverwest Coop.
@LukeStory Plus if I moved over there, it would only cement your place as the geeks-with-bikes house :P
@zacwitte Tomorrow I'll be at the MKE Bike Collective & be back by 2-3PM, if the evening isn't an issue. Alterra on Humbolt? @blissdev?
@LukeStory I live with my brother, no winter move-outs on lease, and I couldn't afford anything more than this place in RW right now. Sorry.
@brennanMKE SysPrefs -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Login Items
Oh, we got trouble, right here in River City..
@brennanMKE Youtube is usually pretty sluggish in actual use on iPhone, in my experience.
Freezing. Still sick. Internet is slow here. And I don't feel up to riding bikes right now. Blah.
@blissdev @zacwitte we should get together & code sometime this weekend. My cable connection is crap lately or I'd invite you all over.
@tronathan Couldn't you grep the Apache logs for error codes?
Anyone want to sell their used Eye Fi for cheap? :&gt;
@brennanMKE I just realized that you can Google Street View across the old Humbolt Ave bridge. Wow, that thing was terrible.
@gregtarnoff Becoming vegan is life-changing. But after that, I've found it's a path of self-discovery & reflection similar to martial arts.
Moving to where the wifi's free (foundry alterra) brewed grounds has crappy 2hr wifi cards Ästill hanging out w/ @zacwitte & @nkatterÑ
damn the man, I'm writing my new personal webapp tool in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/jQuery, and using microformats. Oh, and the db is CouchDB.
At Brewed Grounds on Brady Street with @zacwitte and @nkatter. Hoping @blissdev can make an appearance.
@zacwitte @blissdev I won't be going to the Bike Collective, so any time this afternoon/evening you gentlemen are free to hack, I'm game.
All my joints just popped and it sounded like twigs snapping. I'm getting old.
Just found a nonprofit that needs my skills that I'd like to volunteer at, via the OnMilwaukee.com wishlist. Win.
Morning reading: Why I think Mongo is to Databases what Rails was to Frameworks 
@riverwest A pirate-themed boat-shaped park? ;) That'd be awesome.
Too sore to do Fixmas or even think about bikes today. Sorry @littletinyfish. I wish I hadn't caught the plague, alleycats are fun.
@svdodge I like things other than straight-up vanilla DnD, if you haven't noticed.
@svdodge Oh man. Totally would be into that. I've heard good things about that system.
@svdodge I haven't caught up to 4th ed in DnD. Have 3rd ed, Serenity RPG, Shadowrun, & Star Wars d20. Would really like to try Mouse Guard.
Dear downstairs neighbors: I know that Fridays are normally the night you get drunk and argue loudly, smash things, etc. But canhaz quiet?
@mtbvegan My brother really likes Field Roast tho, where he won't eat tofu or tempeh. Seitan is our middle ground & makes tasty tacos, etc.
Shivering.
Looking to join a tabletop gaming group, or start one if other people on the eastside are interested. Let me know.
Theme for tonight. ♫ 
@chrisgauger and I made Field Roast (the meatloaf kind) and stuffing, plus candied sweet potatoes on the side and some other veggies for me.
Listening to a new compilation I got: Urbs in Horto: A Chicago Indiepop Compilation. 
Being ridiculous: coding in textmate.app, compiling simultaneously in Eclipse and XCode.
Kind of excited to try out Torchlight. Downloaded the demo last night.
Setting up Eclipse for coding. It's been awhile.
Debating shaving off the full beard. Starting to look like Blackbeard the pirate. I don't want to have to put fire in my beard to look cool.
Need black coffee something fierce, but will settle for black tea.
RT @abraham: the.hC: Follow @abraham and win a free Mac mini 
@cthielen Aha! We were plotting on our in a bar, without consulting the web to see if things were active. @zacwitte, @nkatter and I, that is
@blissdev You're missing out on writing vidjagames.
@cthielen we're making plans to revive epiar tonight, right here in this bar.
At the Sugar Maple with @zacwitte & @nkatter.
@cthielen I've heard talk lately of using MongoDB with Rails instead of CouchDB (see:   )
@jeffmke There's a show tonight that @zacwitte wants to check out, it sounds like.
@jeffmke We're thinking about going to Club Garibaldi later.
Installing XCode 3.1.2, downloading Blender. Fighting to build an SDK. Ah, the glamorous life of coding ;)
Third attempt to get XCode 3.1.2 now. Wish my connection would quit killing it, or that Apple's servers would better support download resume
@brennanMKE Well, I'm going to look at it. And after upgrading to Snow Leopard, I need to upgrade my XCode anyways. Was still on XCode 2.5
@tronathan Same. 700+ kbps downloading the iPhone SDK 3.1.2 for Snow Leopard.
Followup to previous tweet: candied yams taste even better roasted under the broiler a second time instead of just microwaved.
Protip: Do not inhale liquid brown sugar which is bubbling and boiling. It will hurt.
Throwing some ideas at @raster and @heygabe for January: 
@smashd Go for it! Sorry, it seemed like one of the better days wrt precipitation and wind, too, from when I was outside earlier.
@smashd Sorry. Maybe once I recover and get a proper winter bike built.
@smashd @svdodge is in Texas, @chrisgauger is in Michigan, @jeffmke is doing the #wbtastetweet4. I'm sick. Doesn't look like it is happening
Ok so @tronathon on the twitters is not the Tronathon I'm thinking of.
I think I saw an @tronathon at the UW Credit Union in the UWM Student Union, but couldn't tell for sure. Not stalking, honest.
Time to ride the bus! Whee!

Thought for the day: Everything's built on reputation. What's your reputation like?"
@cheshster Try to find a local tailor. Fix old shirts & tailor new shirts. Same advice for suits: buy cheap as long as you've got a tailor.
@cheshster Frankly, your dreams scare me.
Last night I had a dream about HOLOGRAMS. Yeah.
Early bed time for me tonight. Final exam test results get posted tomorrow.

My plans to read a bunch of books that I've been putting off is not working out quite as planned. As in, I haven't read anything lately.
@3liza Considered heading for Venus to reunite with long lost spires of the Gauger bloodline. But dirigible needs a proper refit & resupply.
@ashedryden liberally indoctrinate her with some hot Communist propaganda.
Despite actually warming myself up, my body has chosen to continue to involuntarily shiver.
@cheshster slides you might like: 
@svdodge Also, those two being made into movies means that comics I seek out are likely to be made into movies. Or that I have good taste.
Last carton of WestSoy soymilk had an expiration date of 2011. This one that I just bought 2 nights ago from PnS? Expired 05 DEC 09. Damn
What's with making comic book movies before the story is even done & published? See Scott Pilgrim and the Kick Ass movies as evidence.
@ashedryden I may have helped karma along. I keed, I keed.
@ashedryden That's what you get for complaining when I was sick and miserable.
@fragmad @cheshster Made a Yahoo! Pipe to filter tor.com feed so it only shows Charles Stross posts: 
@talktostrangers congrats!
@corbenfrost Word. I've been the sinus-cold-zombie since finals week and it still isn't going away.
What's the etiquette on replying to a job ad and saying "I know you listed this as a full-time position, but I'm available PT & can do it" ?
It's so dead in Alterra on Humbolt. And the streets. And my feedreader. Gah.
@svdodge 
@svdodge It's safe. I think I read somewhere that they're always in your field of vision, but your brain is able to filter them out.
Just got the trick to see blood cells in my retina to work while staring at my suitably-bright LCD screen displaying white background.
@margesmith56 It had gone bad. Those cartons have 2 year expiration dates, so it sat on their shelves for 2 years.
GraphicConverter.app says, "You've been using this software for 1030 days!"
Why doesn't BarCamp Milwaukee have a Wikipedia page? Someone get on that! We need a place to store all the history of #BCMKE 1-4.
Printing is complaining that every piece of paper it grabs is jammed. Gah. That puts a halt on getting this last minute present done.
forgot to remove M$t Office 2004 before I upgraded to Snow Leopard. Now Rosetta isn't installed and I need that to run uninstaller. Lame.
At the end of 2009, no less.
ARGH how can you not have any full-text feeds in 2009?
@ashedryden "ABSTINENCE-ONLY EDUCATE YOURSELF ON THIS."
#lazyweb: Recommend me blogs on neuroscience. #neuroscience
Now that there's snow to walk in, the Chrome lowtop shoes aren't going to get worn. Dunno how the Cordura would hold up to salt, anyways.
@littletinyfish Not bad. Roads were clear as of 7:30 or so when I was first out. Everyone has pretty much got their sidewalks cleared now.
Waiting for Python. But in the end, I may have a new toy to play with.
On Snow Leopard, if you minimize a window to the dock, then hide the app, it disappears from the dock. Clever, but annoying.
Hurray for txt message scams that convince your relatives to give their social security number.
Not ready for the holidays. Grr.
Ok, so I managed to eff up my lower back pretty bad. Was unable to walk, could barely make it to bed and lying down is extremely painful.
@gregtarnoff Movie theaters are one of the only things open on Christmas Day, that's why.
Coffee is some good stuff.

Coding with kitties.
For those that don't know what I'm talking about, go watch  immediately.
Grabbed some old code that runs in Shoooes, playing with Hackety Hack. Generally loving life.
Wishing I could get a netbook. Don't think my laptop's battery will last the ride to Racine. Need to do more CSS hacking.
There's issues with the way my blog looks on my macmini in Chrome: tabs/nav are rounded on top + cheap LCD screen is brighter but washed out
family gift exchange in Racine in an hour. Need to find some tape to wrap gift.
Tweaking blog stuff, passing the feed through Feedburner. So far, so good.
@chrisgauger You may want to put a .htaccess with "DirectoryIndex pyblosxom.cgi" in it in your top level directory.
I should add that I wrote those blog posts when I was exhausted, so they aren't great.
First two blog posts up:   Could use some feedback on the design.
Blog theme is done. Pretty pleased with it. Markdown for markup limits some of the things I could do with say, images, but simpler=better
Wrote bloggy-blog theme and stuff. From scratch. In HTML5. So far, I'm pleased.
They're playing The Price is Right on the wii now. This house oozes American consumerism.
My uncle has reasoned with me that vegetables grow in manure, that veggies aren't vegan. Congrats. Your logic invalidates my lifestyle.
No, I don't listen to Hannah Montana, Mom, and I'm not going to play Hannah Montana Sing-It on their wii. &gt;,&lt;
@svdodge @jeffmke @smashd @littletinyfish feel free to take over and do the ride tonight if you guys will be around.
@mathiasx/mondays-in-milwaukee Not going to be in Milwaukee for the ride tonight. @chrisgauger & I will probably go on a long ride tomorrow.
At Cafe Hollander with my family, having coffee, sweet potato frites & veggie chili.
Just had an awesome idea. Want to implement it immediately. Charging my laptop so I can code during lunch out with the family.
Being recruited by feminists.
@svdodge Related: this book  taught me about becoming a Renaissance man (or woman) was when I was about 12 or 13.
@svdodge Also, my dad really liked your story about libraries and said he had similar experiences growing up in Menomonee Falls.
@svdodge So my dad informed me that you have a blog, earlier today. I'm embarrassed that I wasn't subscribed to it. Luckily, my dad was. &gt;.&gt;
New blog post: blog.mattgauger.com ∴ The First 2500 Are the Hardest 
Doh! Fooled again by FTP timeout! Really need to write a script to automate this. Or ask for the ability to use rsync.
Post-family event decompressing.
So my cousin knows Kevin Bacon. Just moved up in the world.
OH: It's like a rubix cube of milk.
Exhausted and have a skullcrushing headache. Joy.
ZOMG. Merino wool half zip from my parents :D
Gah I have the Price is Right themesong stuck in my head for the car ride home.
OH: Why, it's a Guam quarter!
When will they figure out how to squeeze an iPod shuffle into each iTunes gift card. That'd be worth the $20.
Being coveyed by some sort of motor carriage.
North Ave & 166th Str. We're way out in the boonies.
The set of all computable phenomena.
Little clouds of ultrasonic humidifier fumes rolling through the laptop-lit room.
I should probably use goodreads.com to track what I read, but I always forget. I'd like to have a count/record of all books I read in 2010.
So I'm going to try for bite-sized blog posts every day. We'll see how that goes. Mainly because I can't write awesome long essays every day
New blog post: Purpose 
Twitter convinces me you are all also awake & so I'm totally justified in starting an activity at quarter-to-midnight instead of sleeping.
Also, it's official (because I just checked): got awesome grades for Fall semester.
Hard to keep up momentum on new project & blog. Need internet connection to work but none of the family we've been visiting have internets.
probably shouldn't eat my weight in vitamins all at once. learned my lesson. ow tummy. tomorrow, I should be Superman by all indications.
Making static lightning bolts in the dark with a polar fleece blanket. FOR SCIENCE.
@svdodge I'll keep you updated. More family stuff in Germantown and in Bay View scheduled for tomorrow. Will try to squeeze a bike ride in.
OH: Let me tell you what kind of sandwich you are.
Eating tasty vegan pumpkin pie and drinking decaf chai. Rhymes, heh.
Now the family all complains to me about their computers (and their old obsolete computers that they can't recycle.) yay holidays!
And now: making fun of men that carry bags. Man-purses, etc. Which my messenger bag apparently counts as.
My dad is offering to give up CNN in exchange for never having to watch mom's horse training channel. He's even willing to give up all TV.
Family is playing tech acronym Jeopardy. "oh! Oh! HD? what is.. high definition!"
@nikulr congrats!
Spending holidays alone really isn't that bad when you've got enough books and good music to listen to.
The Smiths – Asleep ♫ 
@chrisgauger Account still exists, but they've upgraded Yahoo Mail had such a tiny inbox that there's nothing but spam in there.
@joshjs I'd say Twitter as website, RSS as web tech, and Google as company of the decade. And Twitter's only been around since August 2006.
 looks well-designed. too bad I don't have an iPhone, & too bad for them that the market is oversaturated with geo apps.
@svdodge It's a decent garment. Can't tell it's merino wool and not a synthetic tech material. I like natural wool too though :D
@svdodge My Icebreaker has this feature to see which sheep it came from: 
@svdodge Cold wash, line dry? I learned that lesson with my wool socks, which got shrunk.
LOVE my merino wool half-zip from Icebreaker. Thanks Mom and Dad! :D Going to be living in it for the rest of the winter. Yes, living.
Grand unified theory of Twitter theme and blog theme.
So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy & sad & I'm still trying to figure out how that could be. - Stephen Chbosky
@joshjs At the time, I guess. I had several POP email addresses on friend's domains after that, but all those mbox files are long lost.
Because I used Yahoo Mail (ugh) & Geocities (double ugh), I don't think I have any record of my online presence from 1999. But I was online.
Fritos has a really cute ad on Hulu with a little lightbulb-headed robot. D'aww.
@nikulr Go big for the new year, get a 27"
This cold has made it impossible to think.
Time to start training myself to write "2010" for dates instead of "2009." I'm sure I'll be screwing that up for awhile.
There's a big ring around the moon tonight. (corona? Halo? Don't know the terminology.-y
Fumbled a phone call.
@whil Are you not using a testing framework?
Need a new project and some motivation go with it.
@chrisgauger ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?!
Mmm. Cinnamon tea.
Easily distracted. Braindead.
Cleaning up a clumsy blog post. Write moar better.
@ashedryden's tasty soup is tasty.
Need to start a get-away-from-the-office retreat/convention called "Burned Out, Man."
Boredom is mental quicksand.
What should we make for dinner? #lazyweb
Moment of inspiration.
It seems that Point of Sale system software is an open source black hole. And for a good reason. It's boring and complex.
Tummy ache. Made brown rice and poured the stir fry sauce on. Nom nom nom.
@svdodge I'm starting to feel fat without constant bike riding. And yeah, I'm not waking up in the morning either.
@ashedryden I think you mean Indiana Jones.
So it turns out that I can't knit.
@ashedryden is going to teach me to knit. Nice knowing you all.

@brennanMKE Textile and Markdown both seem to be required knowledge, at least vaguely, in various circles of developers, currently.
RT @ashedryden: DAMNIT DAVID TENNANT. WHY DID YOU MAKE ME LOVE YOU SO MUCH?! ...newemodoctormsdflakjdghlafdghdfgARGH
@cthielen Certain that software from Tiger was erroring Snow Leopard, causing syslogd to write log file constantly. Couldn't find error, tho
@cthielen This is a disk issue, due to misbehaving software. I am debating wiping it (without a backup of my files, or a way to make one)
macmini is dead.
My macmini is so effed up. I think I need to wipe the HDD and reinstall Snow Leopard on a clean slate. Only I can't run backups, currently.
Also, syslogd is running at 100% CPU. I'm guessing it is filling up the disk with log errors somewhere.
Having a problem with Snow Leopard: My HDD keeps filling up. And installing Snow Leopard freed up 16 gigs of space. So where did it all go?!
I can get a #NexusOne on Verizon? I need to see it in person, but I'm pretty much sold.

A car just went by with a table on the hood. I guess he didn't want to rent a truck.
New blog post: blog.mattgauger.com ∴ This is a Problem 
The other little kicker on this request is that I'm really not academic enough to follow most of the papers posted to Lambda the Ultimate.
Need suggestions for developer/coding blogs. Heavy on interesting, highly technical topics. Light on fads, "social media" and top 10 lists.
Feel like I'm always following the wrong blogs. Right now, all the bike blogs are highly annoying.
So, it turns out that I can in fact knit.
@zacwitte I just got the treehouses song stuck in @ashedryden's head. fight the power, save the treehouses!
Oh: "oh good *reading* 'we are milwaukee's premier vegan salon & spa.' I always wanted hair made out of hydrangeas."
Cleaning up blog post. Images and Amazon item sidebars go in favor of nice plain text punctuated by links.
Working on something neat.
OH: "Did you see the half naked girls in my Twitter?" Me: "Uh. No. I haven't been on Twitter all day. Sorry."
New blog post: blog.mattgauger.com ∴ Feedback Loops and Emergent Behavior 
Way too many unfinished blog posts. It's not even a backlog or a queue. It's a pile of crap.
Why do Ritz crackers need HFCS? Ugh.
I've got more shoveling to do at @ashedryden's house in a bit. #fitmke
@svdodge My hands got sore from the shovel handle well before my arms, legs and back. But I'm using a wooden-handled metal shovel, so YMMV.
I just shovelled&salted my apt bldg's walks then the neighbors' walks. Doubt they'll notice, but it should help if we get even more snow.
Also, there's three people on this bus. One is me. And one is the driver. That could have something to do with it.
Despite the road conditions, the bus is exactly on time.
@Tmtx What goes down unchewed, must come back up. On the carpet.
Cats need to learn to chew their food.
Working on  problems. Project Euler is new to me. Seems like a fun way to keep thinking about coding & practice.
@schmenzer @Giania You should post all your unfinished blog posts, with a warning about their state of incompleteness. Would be interesting.
@antifuchs Sorry to hear about your macmini, though.
@antifuchs My macmini is OK, but it needs to be wiped & 10.6 reinstalled. Something fills the disk w/swap writes until full, then it crashes
@smutandeggs Drive safe if you're heading to Milwaukee tonight. The conditions are pretty bad on the roads.
The axe is sharpened / the crowd roars / and when it's all over / the king is no more.
#autocompletetweet: Went on the roads are really not feeling awake. Do you get online? We get online. It will take a shower and see how they
@antifuchs Instead of adding it back all at once, add albums when you want to listen to them. At least, that is what I'm planning to do.
OH: When it rains, it snows.
Dr. Livingstone's Journal: Day 14. Attempts to teach the natives the Meow Mix song have proved unsuccessful. I may have to resort to bribes.
@ashedryden That'd be too hard (actually coding apps in C/C++ rather than drawing in Photoshop.) This guy is to blame: 
Chunky ba-con!
@svdodge And setup up FTP for sharing mp3s. May have to restrict that to the wired network though, so it doesn't swamp wireless.
@svdodge First task may be getting iTunes DJ suggestions to work. Or maybe use the LPD print daemon as an mp3 queue: 
@plural @blissdev @svdodge Any suggestions for a convenient location to meet? (Alterra tends to be loud, crowded, etc) Otherwise, I can host
Really need to get a winter bike built and start doing the #mondays-in-milwaukee-ride too. #todo
If this snow gets all cleaned up by Saturday, would anyone want to do a Milwaukee #devhouse/#coderaving event on Saturday night? I can host.
Since my macmini died (music is on its ext hdd) & I'm on my laptop, I'm depending on last.fm and Pandora for music. So far, so good.
@joshjs It asks if you're vegan or vegetarian, then proceeds to recommend non-vegan / non-vegetarian foods. Heh. Oh well.
@schmenzer I had some these-are-only-titles blog posts too: 
@jennaddenda I wish I was there!
@antifuchs Did you lose the music or just the iTunes library file?
I can't believe Half Price books has so many Java, c++, .NET etc books and nothing for javascript
Thinking about starting a coffee/tanning/cigarettes/liquor store. I'll call it "addictions & cancer store"
Oh, and if you want to bring soda or snacks, that'd be awesome. I'll have plenty of coffee & we'll have a veggie tray w/ vegan dip.
I'll be hosting a devhouse / coderaving event  at my apartment tonight, starting at 7. DM me if you need the address.
@plural that'd be awesome. If we get one more place we can alternate through the month?
Had a good time last night @AJBombers. Will have to stay longer & try the veggie burger next.. Seems I missed a few people by leaving early.
@plural True. I'm thinking if we want to make it weekly, we can rotate locations. I need to ask @tapps about the @tappsestate :D
Heading to @AJBombers. Will be there in about half an hour, by GMaps+MCTS estimates. Need a night out among people. @jeffmke @brennanMKE etc
For a guy who used to be into Jeeps, the articulation at 1 min on this chain-driven 4x4 is crazy: 
Coffee that'll wake the dead. Considering going out tonight.
The Roomba picks up the rock salt much better than the regular vacuum. I have it cleaning the kitchen on Max to clear feet-stabbing salt.

@mkehackerhouse definitely worked for me. Why? Waking up at 7:30AM to code, full of inspiration, even though I fell asleep after 2AM.
The first @mkehackerhouse was a success, by my book. Actually got some coding done, which is better than the last few BarCamps I've been to.
So apparently @ashedryden has all the funny things I've ever said on twitter favorited.
More memories: Making Robert Scoble talk about me: 
Reminiscing: 
OH: "I'm getting to the point where I'm just  going to steal her hose."
Now that I've seen @plural's Nexus One, I want one. Badly.
@plural Hopefully we're not too distracting.
@Narkalant It helps that your photo is so awesome.
OH: "This is delicious Alabama pizza."
So @mkehackerhouse now exists. And may follow you if you expressed interest in my little get-together.
Imagining a country owned by Google. #mkehackerhouse.
Love the diversity of conversations going on here: Picasa versus other photo hosting, @plural and I discussing Google dev practices.
Got a new Lowepro backpack at Half Price Books for free today, after trading in a books I'll never read again & CDs I'll never listen to.
@ashedryden Issues on Drupal? Say it ain't so! I keed, because I &lt;3 Drupal
I'm about one tick out of sync with the rest of this conversation.
RT @ashedryden: Hanging out with @blissdev, @plural, @svdodge, and @mathiasx.
All macs here tonight. Apple ftw.
@narkalant Setting background to Woodgie: 
@blissdev and @svdodge showed up so far. Talking fixing Apple laptops and the Google Nexus One.
Mke code raving / devhouse at my place in 30 mins! (7pm) Bring snacks or soda and something awesome to work on! DM for more details
@brennanMKE Try celery. It actually costs your body calories to digest it. Negative calorie food!
OH: "Super Mario Jesus? SUPER MARIO JESUS!"
Is XCode's version of gcc trying to compile *.c files as  Objective-C? WTF!
Also: learned a new git trick. Huzzah.
I had this crazy idea of rolling my own Streaks-style calendar using unit testing tools. As long as the calendar stays green, I'm doing good
Google Reader's Explore Tab thinks I can read Spanish or Portuguese, for some reason.
@jeffmke Mondays (in) Milwaukee! ;)
Anyone else planning on the #MiM ride tonight? Just curious.
You show me what is possible and it scares me, but I continue anyways.
I need to create vegan nutella.
My phone is being lame.
@ashedryden That's not vegan.
We'll be doing the #Mondays-in-Milwaukee-Ride tonight. Meet 6PM outside Cafe Hollander. Dress warm!
Cold.
Effing job ad scams.
So, there's a big wave of inspiration to ride on. Whee.
Nomination for bets headline ever: Skywalkers in Korea Cross Han Solo 
@nikulr DiffEq and Calc3, and then Intro to Philosophy (SOCSCI-250) to round out the number of credits.
@nikulr That sucks.
@nikulr Wait, what?
Cleaning up old links from  but it is in terrible need of a full redesign.
@rockmanac Not on PowerPC! :/
I'm trying OmmWriter ( as a tool for writing blog posts. Will let Twitter know what I think about it, of course
Putting Google Chrome OS on my Powerbook by way of Qemu. Yeah, I miss Google Chrome that much.
WE WOKE UP AND IT WAS ALL A DREAM. A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE DREAM.
@Narkalant It's ok. She thinks everyone is talking about her. Even the cats.
OH: Detective, you are seriously out of line!
"We're Ooooooowl exterminators."
OH: "No more OHing for you. I'm going to change your twitter password next."
@ashedryden just banned me from twitter in her router config.
OH: "I'm the cat whisperer."
GOLD GLORIA ESTEBANN HOW DID YOU GET IN MY TWEET WTF
@ashedryden Stop sitting on my laptop!
Reading @ashedryden's tweets out loud as she types them.
@ashedryden is pushing my buttons.
OH: You spelled 'wood' wrong.ddddddddddddddddddddddtfr
OH: "That's not what I said!"
OH: "I said sing, not dance."
OH: "I forgot you're here. Sometimes I dance.. for the cats."
OH: "Can you inject me with green liquid? PLEASE? I wanna be a mutant!"
@ashedryden You're a ballerina kitty?
IN OTHER NEWS: WOOOO PENICILLIN.
I ate four pieces of expired bread before I decided the bread was no good.
OH: "The world is a terrifying place if you're orange."
Talking to the bread in the kitchen.
Got Neal Asher's The Skinner the other day at Half Price. Enjoying it thoroughly so far.
@ashedryden I WILL CLICK EVERYTHING.
@ashedryden I heard (from your laptop) that every click online creates "COOKIES" (with air quotes)
I came, I saw, I slid around a lot in the slush and nearly died at least once.
Way late to cafe hollander. Had some brake issues. Sorry if i missed anyone who showed up. Heading home now.
That whole bit about the harder they fall. Proving itself true.
@brennanMKE They have lots of vegan options, but most are deep-fried. If you're looking to go low calorie, try making salad w/fresh veggies?

RT @mkehackerhouse: Next MKE Hacker House is at the @tappestate at 7PM on Saturday (Jan 16th)! Mark our calendars and bring cool project ...
Going back to Tweetie for Twitter, instead of the website. BECAUSE TWEETING ABOUT TWITTER HABITS IS SO META-AWESOME.
Maybe if I walk on tiptoes I won't wake up this genie and make all the magic disappear. Where's my ballerina shoes?
With nothing to do all day and no people around, things take on their own new levels of frustration and shittiness. Pardon my French.
@narkalant re: Neal Asher. Have you read the Spatterjay books yet? I'm partial to Cormac as a character but enjoying The Skinner so far.
You know the day is going well when you wake up and have to call the credit card fraud department.
Drupal is all fun and games until someone loses an $i (variable) and we go trudging into raw PHP, explaining variable scope with puppets.
Her: "Why are you making the sad face noise?" Me: "The sad /face noise/?" Her: "The noise you make when your face is sad."
Thick layer of salt on sidewalk because it was an ice rink. Worse, it is slanted. Going to have to call the landlord & see what can be done.
Despite my doomsday device and sharks with friggin lasers, I still can't give someone more hours in the day to get stuff done.
Ouch! My bag bit me! Stupid enchanted bag of laptop holding.
@Arlen I'll see you at @Web414 then. Also, do you have a recommendation for a unit testing book besides the xUnit book? I don't do much .NET
The fact that I can no longer change my twitter design is highly annoying. Changes to color/design/background image don't save.
@nikulr congrats ;)
#lazyweb: Good technical books. Recommend them. All topics. THE LEARNING. I CRAVES IT.
@Arlen The free intro chapter PDF didn't wow me, but maybe I'll give it another chance. Thanks.
@Arlen Did you find Prag Thinking & Learning worth it? I've been studying neuroscience & books like the Mind Hacks are basic in comparison.
What's an interesting technical book you've read in the last year? Looking for new stuff to read. Especially outside of my "comfort zone."
@whil I try that every few months. Then I come crawling back for more coffee.
@Tmtx & the best (omnivore) way I can think of in the morning is cup o' coffee & an omelet with black bean salsa for breakfast + vitamins.
@Tmtx Seconded. I prefer the coffee + complex carb/complete protein food (read:black beans) + sublingual B12 + 1000mg Vitamin C.
My phone died at Roast. Lamesauce. Need to get &lt;s&gt;another charger&lt;/s&gt; a new phone.
At Roast. Drinking a Red Eye. Trying to catch up on realtime*
@trodrigues I have been since the beginning of last year. But I've been scraping by and going to school (which has been working out well)
Also also, if anyone wants to hire a bike mechanic in Milwaukee, I'd love to do that. #mightaswelltry
Also, I'm looking to pick up some freelance work. If anyone needs a Rails, PHP, Python, *SQL, JavaScript, or-whatever-you-need-done, ninja.
OH myself: "I WONDER HOW MUCH SHIPPING A MINOTAUR IS"
@darrickhartman were they tied with ethernet cable?
@svdodge I can't stay awake either. Need to get more coffee..
@ashedryden is pulling BarCamp rank on us. "Back at BCMKE 1... We had to walk uphill both ways to get internets.."
Working on the clean-up crew. And by clean-up, I mean cupcake clean-up.
OH: "My wife had to remind me that using Twitter at home counts as working at home."
There's no internet connection at Bucketworks yet, so I spent Web414 whittling down the number of To-Read tabs on my laptop.
OH: "This is @web414. We don't talk about how to make money on the internet."
#notfoursquarecheckin: S State Str, Beaver Dam, WI.
We got the most amazing 12-grain whole wheat bread from the MKE Winter Farmer's Market from Water House Foods.
At the Milwaukee Winter Farmer's Market. All the meat, cheese & dairy products being thrown at me as samples is depressing.
Tonight is @MKEHackerHouse! 7pm at the @tappsestate! Bring code! Bring friends! Bring snacks to share! See you there!
Thinking about going big for 2010. 23" widescreen big, that is.
Plotting to teach Murray (the cat) to play the wii. gonna make him a little wiimote backpack.
Having Tofutti (fake ice cream) to show @ashedryden that I don't need dairy products anymore. mmm, chemicals :P
Now We Can See by The Thermals is a great album. That is all.
New blog post: Web414 January 2010 recap 
Ok. Enough playing with the blog. It's time to get my code on.
Wrote a blog post from notes (on real paper!) from Web414 on Thurs. Don't really feel like editing it to be /good/ so I'm just uploading it.
Beaver Dam was farther away than I expected. Exhausted, but I'm at @mkehackerhouse. Party on!
@svdodge We were at the farmer's market right around noon. sorry that we missed you.
Need to get home and clean. @chrisgauger is coming back today.
@Lyndzi that sucks! :/
I didn't want to play up the sympathy card or anything. Just feeling stuck and fail.
I'm to the point where I'll have to start selling plasma and selling my stuff on eBay (except I don't have anything worth anything to sell.)
I have 23 unread items in my feedreader, all videos. My powerpc can't play flash videos without stuttering. Lamesauce.
@corbenfrost Only months that end in -y
@ashedryden poor sick girl :(
Need to buy my textbooks. Only I can't find them used online cheap. Gaaah. Amazon used price is only about $5 cheaper than new price.
@ashedryden That sounds like an insult. "Oh yeah? Well, your in-laws own iPhones! Ooooo, burn!"
This month is poised to get hairy.
Let me rephrase that previous request for freelance work: If you've got a neat problem, I want to find a solution for that problem for you.
@mariehuynh Well @mkehackerhouse is in Milwaukee. Which makes it far more awesome.
Breaking out the salsa and chips at @mkehackerhouse
I have very simple needs, and the pretzels at @MKEHackerHouse are apparently one of them.
@arlen The Productive Programmer by Neal Ford is winning out over Pragmatic Thinking and Learning for current technical book I'm reading.
@tapps's cat (accidentally) created a guest account on Tracy's laptop and logged into it. That cat is l33t.
@whil You're missing out! @mkehackerhouse
Trying a combination of new leggings, rolled up cargo pants, and wool socks tonight. Hoping it is warm enough.
My old pal stomach acid is back before the bike ride. Ugh. BILE.
OH "We're the third most popular search on Google in the past hour. /Wow/"
OH "Serving seventy thousand page views per second.. that's pretty gnarly."
3px border radius are my friends.
Internet connection here has ground to a halt. Lame.
@svdodge Sounds good to me.
I don't run ads on my blog, but I use Amazon affiliate links. What's the standard for disclosing that? disclosurepolicy.org doesn't cover it
@svdodge Yeah. It will be a short ride. My fitness level demands a short ride, as do my lungs in cold weather. Although it is warmer today.
So I'll be riding tonight. 6PM, Cafe Hollander. Bring lights and warm clothes. @reply or DM if you're planning to come #MiMRide
Time to go to Whole Foods and find a mailbox!
So whoever stole my credit card # put more charges on it, even though it was supposed to be cancelled. Gah annoying.
At Alterra on Humbolt. Who would've guessed? ;)
@Arlen Tell them it'll require an unknown pile of cash.
"i got here and there was oatmeal and mouse poop all over the place" -- @ashedryden
I need coffee.
@Timfastic Uhh, Franklyn. Try that one out. Don't say I didn't warn you. Warn you about what? You'll see.
Watching Inglorious Basterds with @chrisgauger and my dad.
The black bean burger at @AJBombers is really tasty. i was hungrier than i thought!
Going to dinner at @AJBombers with my dad & @chrisgauger.
Props to @blissdev for catching me writing a crummy blog post, that is. Gah. I can't brain today.
Does anyone want to ride tomorrow night? #mondays-in-milwaukee-ride / #MiMRide
@abraham Any reason to roll your own lifestream aggregator over using Tumblr, soup, blog sidebars, etc?
@joshjs I'd rather have 0 unread, so I can focus on real things, than try to convince the dinosaur brain that unread count is a TODO list.
@joshjs And by that I mean, "Hide unread counts", "Show updated" and keep it minimized. All Items will still show shared though.
@joshjs Yeah. Tempted to just turn off People You Follow tbh.
@joshjs Yeah. I can't tell it "No Thanks" when a recommended feed is a GReader Shared Items feed from a Google user.
Lessons learned tonight: URIs should always be absolute, never relative.
Google Reader's Explore functionality needs a Ban / Don't Show Me This Stuff Anymore button. Seriously.
Potential band name: Bulletproof Disclosure Policy.
Racing the pizza guy.
Good #mondays-in-milwaukee-ride. Thanks to @svdodge for coming out and riding his skinny tire singlespeed in the cold.
 - @svdodge Well, that was a dangerous place I decided to ride (the hill in Riverside park next to Urban Ecology Cen
Hello, headache.
@DDysart I had one of those too, on a 286.

Found notes from @brennanMKE's talk on Javascript from the November 2008 web414: 
Well, I'm all out of coffee here. Maybe it is time to move on to the next warm wifi-enabled spot. Or go home.
In the interest of being lazy, I'm finishing half-written blog posts from my Drafts folder.
@Arlen re:pomodoro 
@ashedryden I never went to Pizza Man.
I was able to delete 13 apps off my laptop, and my laptop didn't have many programs to begin with. Google products have replaced everything.
@ashedryden count me as a fanboy, I guess.
Banged my knee up pretty good tonight (not while riding my bike!) icepack + ibuprofen and trying not to bend it too much. gah.
@joshjs I've cut things down drastically, esp. considering I followed 500+ feeds in the past. 58 feeds now, mostly webcomics & my own feeds.
watching the @Web414 video while I wait for @ashedryden to get home from work. also, have a bunch of tabs of Boba Fett research open.
@antifuchs Also:  haha
In other news, my blog's Amazon links have had one click, no sales, 4%. At this rate, I may perhaps be able to afford my textbooks in 2210.
@antifuchs @trodrigues Incidentally I don't think I've ever typed 'sl' by mistake instead of 'ls' Is it a non-qwerty keyboard thing?
@antifuchs @trodrigues At first I thought you guys were talking about Second Life.
Mmm. Frozen blackberries.
@obrazu college lines. first day of the semester. Needed my U-Pass! and dropped off some records with financial aid, but that was line #2.
Still in the same line.
In a long line.
iPod is dead. Feeling ill. Unrelated.
@chrisgauger I bought the wrong bananas! #seriously
@disqus I had to make an account on your site. Still is an extra hurdle for people commenting on my blog, rather it not email them either.
Late to my first class of the new semester. I guess the rush hour buses take at least 20 minutes longer.
@svdodge Honestly, I don't like the common solution for my static blog generator: Disqus.com, because it spams you w/ email as a commentator
@svdodge On twitter works.
@joshjs Oh?
New blog post:  (Didn't reach a conclusion but this has been a draft too long)
Of course, there is a 
Trying to be quiet & stay out of the way, now that my work is done.
I'm not really being a ninja right now. More like using my once-per-day barbarian bezerker rage on some CSS.
@mariehuynh MKEHackerHouse this weekend will be my apartment again. Then I think @plural wanted to host next weekend.
Giving a navbar a makeover. Removing unnecessary old Javascript where CSS works better & CSS image replace adds some semantic value to links
OH: It looks like the top of your head is a canoe.
@tapps I think we tried that once. Having old screenshots helps where archive.org failed to crawl.
@tapps I could share some old sites of mine that were terrible, if it makes you feel better.
@tapps Actually, archive.org has it: 
I can smell warm food baking and it is driving me crazy!
@tapps It looks good!
@joshjs Random followup: tumblr or mathias.soup.io ? More coding links/quotes on Soup because I use Soup bookmarklet, only repost on tumblr.
@smutandeggs I know to add a phone to our family plan is $10/mnth more. On AT&T family plans, adding unlimited txts adds it for all phones.

Bus stop. Been up for nearly an hour. This new class schedule will kill me with all the (not)sleep i'm getting.
@corbenfrost Tacos are for Tuesdays. It is most definitely a Thursday right now.
Need to blog, soon. Not sure what to write about, yet.
@lakeicychill I've got a whole bag of oranges here.
@manfredmacx sudo make me a pot of coffee
I should make a pot of coffee. Early class means afternoon crash.
@abraham Pics?
It is hard to believe it has been a whole year. Best year of my life, though.
@ashedryden  - This stuff looked so gross. All the jars looked like the machine shat Baconnaise in them.
@corbenfrost re:soccer team. I think it's like having a softball team.
@corbenfrost I had two huge burritos last night, tho.
@corbenfrost i'm in the same lack-of-sleep boat this week. Maybe not so extreme as yours tho
@corbenfrost OH me: "Hey Ashe, Corben says to never watch while eating Fringe. I mean. err."
No content yet, but I just put this up: 
@brennanMKE And write a hook to flush the cache when you change it. Except that just adds complexity to what would be best as static file.
@brennanMKE @ashedryden But a CSS generator that set colors, etc in one place might work. Run once when code changes, not every page load.
@brennanMKE @ashedryden not sure that PHP is the best CSS preprocessor then, unless you wanted to access PHP variables in Drupal / your app.
Anyone out there doing serious web development or software engineering on a netbook? Just curious.
Unfortunately the MIPS (not x86) CPU in the Lemote Yeelong "performs comprehensively as well as the high-end Pentium3 and low-end Pentium 4"
On usesthis.com RMS says he uses a Lemote Yeelong, netbook that runs free software down to the BIOS. Not avail in US, $330 Euros elsewhere.
At Bombay Sweets. I've wanted to come here for a long time!
Addendum: Bay View & south side is fine, Shorewood/WFB as well. Stallis, Waukesha & farther are probably too far to be worth it.
Dear Milwaukee foodies:Looking for brunch in MKE with at least one vegan option. Already excluded: Fuel, Comet, Beans, Palomino, Hotchado.
@jeffmke Busy at Roast today?
I need some coffee.
@ashedryden For context, it was Tin Man's baddies cutting down a Munchkin treehouse village with chainsaws. Ewok village would've been toast

@mtbvegan Professor considers the TI-89 "cheating" :P
Looks like I may have to buy an old TI-86 calculator from eBay, or convince my professor to let me use Mathematica running on a Netbook.

@ashedryden is using Terminal.app and git and it is making me a little teary-eyed.
@KeVroN Upload is done, @Disqus turned on. Comment away!
Things on my blog are going to be a little broken until the upload finishes, btw.
Iterative development on the blog means that I'm pushing a few updates now, including Disqus comments, but haven't finished the redesign yet
@KeVroN Looking at how people have embedded @Disqus in Jekyll now.
Decided my blog's design looks pretty amateurish. Lots of work to do.

Blech, too many openID's spread across too many services. Used to keep everything on claimid.com but haven't had reason to use it lately.
Drinking energy drinks. Reading coding blogs. #hyperspeed #icanseeforever
Teaching @ashedryden to use git. Yay!
Mass email sent out requesting help on a new project. If you know me, you're probably getting an email right now.

Less than an hour to go before the Mondays in Milwaukee Ride. Anyone planning to come ?
@riverwest Thanks for the link! :D
So just to reiterate: @mkehackerhouse 1/30/10 at 7PM,  and Mondays in Milwaukee Ride 6PM @ Cafe Hollander
I wake up every morning and decide I'm not doing enough random side projects. #stress #yay #SleepIsForTheWeak.
RT @mkehackerhouse: MKE Hacker House is on! Jan 30, 2010 @ 7PM in Riverwest. See site for details and a spiffy map!  ...
@JoeSteve It'll run Leopard(10.5) I still use Powerbook G4. Batteries cost ~$40. OTOH, eBay listings are finishing at $240 for your laptop.
@usesthis BTW:  & 
Follow-up to last tweet: more interviews on the way! Need to sort out a proper RSS feed. Until then, announcing new interviews on Twitter.
Announcing:  a little project I've been working on. Interviews with @philgerbyshak, @ashedryden & myself
@whil Is there ever any moment when your life isn't overscheduled?
Mondays are the worst. Usually.
@whil it won't be *that* bad.
@usesthis What started as a new jekyll template for a classy About Me page is turning into something cool. Will keep you posted.
@usesthis Yep!
Tomorrow is another Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride. 6PM outside Cafe Hollander. Weather should be decent. #MiMRide
Getting vegan tacos at the RW Coop.
@svdodge Season 1 gets a lot better past the first few episodes. Probably my favorite season of Buffy.
I feel like I'm making paper machè.

@ashedryden worms make the best pets!
Free online books that I'm saving to read later:   #todo
@whil Wouldn't want a bug on Finnish Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade 64bit to slip through though!
@whil Probably want to have it build the installer exe and then save those to a build-date dir on your backup server.
@whil VMWare for each. Don't forget foreign languages. Set up your continuous integration server to compile, run integration tests, etc.
Headed to Alterra to buy a lb of coffee to get me thru the week. Would've brought my laptop but who wants to listen to Radiohead on repeat?
Introducing: Gabe Wollenburg  on The WI Setup.
Need coffee. Gah.
For some reason, getting to the 8am class is easy. Getting to the 9am class on time is tougher.
@KeVroN You know @raster. Always so angry.
Home from the ride. It is a little nasty out there with the wind. Had a good time though.
No one here. Heading out #mimride
What started out as pancake batter just went into a loaf pan in the oven. PANCAKE BREAD.
The iPad is definitely not for me.
Huh. iPad. Expecting "I'm a netbook and I'm an iPad" commericals with Shia Labouf as the iPad.
@ckittel In Soviet Russia, unit test greens you.
Due to Lack of Interest, Tomorrow Has Been Canceled.
The coffee I ground for tomorrow morning (coffee maker alarm clock was the best idea ever) smells SO good. Kind of want to brew it right now
@whil Brownies? .. Are they vegan? Are they still up for dibs? &gt;.&gt;
OH: "Just like you need a boating license for a bike.."
OH: "My cats are nicer than you... They're nicer even though I have to clean up their poop! What does that say about you?"
Random confessions: I spent 45 minutes messing with Evernote when I was supposed to be reading and "taking notes" from textbook.

Time to be overwhelmed. Whee.
OH: "Ew, it looks like a finger! Stop it!"
@ashedryden They hear me chewin', they hatin'.
these dehydrated papayas (AKA FRUIT-BACON) are pretty tough.
It is so cold that my molars hurt
Anyone using an ASUS 1001P? Just curious. Seems to be the cheapest "seashell" eeePC with the latest (N450) Atom processor.
I'm about 2 dozen books behind on my ebook reading, but spending so much of the day away from my laptop is keeping me from catching up.
I really need a portable PDF reader, btw.
@ericaconway @nikulr 
@ericaconway Nope! pic on the way. &gt;.&gt;
Also, annoying: Can't find my camera's USB cable. Don't own any sort of card reader.
I guess 2010 has the same calendar as 1999: Jan started on a Friday and Feb only had 28 days. So according to newton: part like it's 1999!
Gah. I pulled out my Newton, only to remember that I never got around to applying the 2010-bug patch to the OS.
@nic0 in other news, the bobbies will soon be closing in on the Angel Pub to arrest them all over again on different charges.
@brennanMKE Nexus One unlocked costs more for less pixels, less storage, and probably less processing power. TMob plan costs more. #TeamiPad
@nikulr I can take math notes on it. Even the iPhone can't do that! :P
@nikulr playing with it is so much more fun
@nikulr remind me to bring my Apple Newton to class some time. Don't really want to carry it in addition to my 15 pounds of math textbooks.
Sad that there weren't any updates to the Apple Newton line today. Oh well. Maybe next decade.
I wonder what kind of hardware I/O the dock connector and he iPad SDK open up. Personal robot butler with the Apple Alex voice, anyone?
@nikulr we need to go after the publishers then :P
@smutandeggs Did you turn off Javascript or CSS in your browser? Looks like CSS isn't loading.
@nikulr the details I remember were that it would only run on computer lab & library computers and it would be added to everyone's tuition.
@nikulr Too bad the e-textbook software that MATC Student Govt has been "testing" for years is irrelevant after the release of Kindle & iPad
@atomicfork Only if it is your time of the month!
RT @Masque: Apple has released what is unquestionably the most impressive universal remote in history.
@compujeramey Maybe we can usea mesh network of  these instead of an electric fence in the canal down in Chicago.
Will the iPad defend Lake Michigan from Asian Carp?!
Pancake bread is delicious. I'll post the recipe online someday but I'm sure you can figure it out.
No iPhone OS 4.0? No mulitasking apps? grr.

@nikulr Considering dropping my cellphone entirely and just having one of these, instead of a netbook or a laptop.
@nikulr Damn. Ok. iPad /is/ for me. More than an iPod touch or an iPhone.
@corbenfrost Har har. Says the guy from the Windy City, where I nearly froze to death. Twice.
@brennanMKE Haha, burn on that CEO. He leaked harder than a sieve.
That lack of magical ponies and unicorns flowing from the perfect device that is the iPad leaves me feeling cold and hollow inside.
The lack of a GPS in the iPad will seriously hinder its adoption with.. oh, who am I kidding? I am not qualified to talk about this at all.
@blissdev Agreed.
Ghost in the Shell -- be human ♫ 
The 64gig Apple iPad with 3G and 24 months of service is $1549. The 32gig iPhone 3GS with 24 months of service + unlimited txts = $1979.
My Powerbook G4 scores a 692 on Geekbench 2. @ashedryden's Macbook Pro scores 3720. 1.6Ghz Atom-powered netbook scores 932, even. Ouch.
Finally getting around to watching the iPad keynote. Not that I really have the time with all this homework.
So many things, so little time.
@whil As long as that terminal is virtual. Wait, you're not on a teletype, are you?!
@mariehuynh sounds like a neat gig! is this the one you have to leave MKE for, though?
@cthielen haha. He's actually a pretty awesome math professor!
OH: "The iPad won't need Google. It'll read your thoughts and tell you want you want to know." -- our professor, telling us this as fact.
The thing I haven't seen anyone ask today: If the iPad can do 64Gb, where's the 64gig iPhone? huh? :P
Trying to go back to Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 on my macmini. Powerbook's Bluetooth has been funky since upgrading to Leopard.
@smashd congrats!
Sometimes I drink something other than coffee. Like right now. Spicy V8. Yum!
@rockmanac Will it read any old PDF? Do I need to convert it to ePub and somehow get it uploaded to the device? (no local filesystem afaik)
This may let me move my coding into the cloud, which is a cool concept. I could even host it on my own site or perhaps Amazon EC2 instance!
Checking out Mozilla's Bespin, an in-browser editor project  It has builtin Mercurial SCM & collaboration features
@joshjs Just think of all the time you're not standing in that bitter cold!
The monitor on my macmini is making my eyes bleed. Can't adjust it to look right.
@abraham I want an @AwesomeLists invite
@mariehuynh aha, it's one of those ultraportables with an Intel CULV proc. Curious to see how those perform compared to an Atom processor.
Need to ban myself from Twitter for awhile. Still can't focus.
@tronathan Agreed. I made the mistake of locating my computer desk in corner of two outside walls. Uninsulated walls.
@antifuchs Yeah. Javascript-based Commodore 64 emulator anyone?
@mariehuynh Which netbook?
@raster 
@Tmtx Thanks!
@corbenfrost Turns out Pandora doesn't work on my laptop (b/c it is flash) Last.fm radio usually gets into terrible/obscure music fast.
@petdance Personally I'm waiting until I can afford a Casio CDP-100. YMMV. Also, Brass Bell on Silver Spring has a good keyboard showroom.
@petdance Otherwise, the issue is that keys on most cheap keyboards feel terrible. Look for velocity sensitive, weighted keys & USB port.
@petdance Antique pianos can be had on CL cheap if you have a way to move it. Then it'll cost a bit to have a piano tuner come (worth it!)
Trying not to be a failure in the Dreamhost contest.
Where should I listen to free music online? What should I listen to? Taking suggestions.
@alexfalkenberg maybe a website like tryruby.org that runs on the browser is the best bet.
@alexfalkenberg Kids really should have /something/ to play with. Hell, I want to play with code on the bus. Even a Lego Mindstorms-like UI.
Something I didn't know: There's absolutely *no* little toy programming languages in the iPhone app store?! Not even BASIC or Logo?!
RT @mkehackerhouse: Just a reminder: You *must* RSVP for @mkehackerhouse on Saturday night! Do so here: 
Don't put a grid background behind a block of text. *Especially* if you're not using Blueprint CSS or something to actually space things out
Oh my. Just read a "Found out there's free versions of Microsoft development tools called Eclipse and MySQL! Must be illegal!" blog post.
Frustrating when one can't get in the zone. Stuck on the metaphorical roadside between Scatterbrained Drive and Can't-Make-It-Work Street.
@svdodge It sounds interesting.
Not many people are talking about it, but the back of the iPad is gorgeous 
Now that I have finished the Neal Asher book, I need a new dead tree book to read on the bus. Suggestions?
@margesmith56 I was out on my bike in cold weather like that on Modnay. Also, @ashedryden says you're crazy.
OH: "But then you decided to burn me. With your lava."
@whil I'd recommend an app like Tofu.app, if you can find one for your OS-of-choice.
@blissdev and I are using Mozilla's Bespin in collaborative mode like a coder's Google Wave.
@joshjs Moving again?
I need to write a blog post tonight! Gah! #project52
@ashedryden Indiana Jones is great, too. Star Wars is just #epic.
People need to stop using the name 'mathiasX' on forums and web apps. This name belongs to me, and the X is never capitalized. That is all.
@raster re:  Git is full of win! Did you keep using it? Also, look into git-svn if you use Subversion
Finished cleaning up for @mkehackerhouse. Maybe some last minute decluttering to do yet.
@raster Quicktime had that, hah :)
@sixohsix I've tried as many as possible, & kept returning to Monaco 9pt w/o antialiasing. But now my eyes have decreed 13pt Droid Sans Mono

@gregtarnoff 
@gregtarnoff Vegan with a Vengeance's chickpea noodle soup, only I used home-made spinach noodles and added wild rice. We ate every last bit
@corbenfrost Today it looked like 
I don't know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. #unfollowparty
So, I'm semi-seriously looking for a plastic Core 2 Duo Macbook to start using as my new laptop. If you're looking to get rid of one, DM me.
@usesthis another awesome one. I like his answer to the last question. Any tips for getting people to reply to interview requests?
So if anyone wants to hire me to build stuff with any of those pieces of technology, let me know :-)
I need to build some more cool stuff in Ruby/RoR, jQuery, MongoDB/CouchDB, AWS, git, and HTML5, in no particular order.
@arlen Dunno if you've seen this already: 
Really spaced out today.
@raster We should start #eataplant.
Going through the list of countries we would and wouldn't live in with @ashedryden.
Wow, the blog post I wrote at midnight last night for #project52 is all over the place and doesn't really make any sense. Lovely.
@svdodge Since you've been talking about a blog redesign: 
Potential band name: poorly drawn giraffes (via @ashedryden)
Eating leftover pizza from last night's @MKEHackerHouse and drinking a big cup of coffee.
I have 7 minutes to do a blog post. Whee.
Hipster giraffes.
@ashedryden's life has new meaning now that she has the bus stop GMail theme.
OH: "I hate dot-info domains as much as I hate singing children."
I have to "puts" it.
"I wish Gabe was on Twitter all the time." -- @ashedryden "Or on ustream all the time, so we can just watch him." -- @svdodge.
Falling asleep at @mkehackerhouse and I'm the host. Oops.
@joshjs Wait until I perfect caffeinated bacon! #caffeine
@heygabe If you say something quotable and no one is there to OH it, did it really happen?
There's not much I want to blog about right now.
@ashedryden Shush.
OH: "@joshjs needs to know about baconated coffee right away." - me
I'm making pizza from scratch for @mkehackerhouse! (vegan cheese for mine, regular cheese for omnivores)
Ok, I'm off to ride. Hope to see /all/ of you there!
@trodrigues I probably screwed that up (regexes always take a few tries for me) but it should give you some idea.
@trodrigues Use -iregex /*[^.mp3]/ ?
In other news, I wish my cellphone's battery hadn't died about 2 hours ago. Have people to call/txt & cycling to partake in.
Heading out soon to pick up my fixed gear bike from its secret winter storage facility. Then off to the Mondays-in-Milwaukee ride.
@whil Or use 1Password / whatever is equivalent+secure and runs on your OS-of-choice. I personally hate Keychain applications.
@whil Use strong encryption on a txt file if you really need to securely store a bunch of logins for remote machines, websites, etc.
@whil If your hint is the actual password, your security fails. If it is "my birthday" or anything useful to an intruder, security fails.
Password hints are the worst idea ever.
Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride happens tonight at 6pm outside Cafe Hollander, for those who want to brave the cold on their bikes.
@rockmanac Same. I can setup Unix network interfaces and write firewall rules, but not in DOS :-)
@rockmanac Common answers to this network/workgroup issue include "Enable TCP/IP protocol" and enable/disable the ethernet card. Very useful
@rockmanac In this case, that worked..
Forums for Windows issues are so terrible that I frequently facepalm while searching for answers. Microsoft support docs as well.
I got tired of using 'ping' on Windows XP so I'm writing 'poing' the audio (sonar noise) ping utility.
@AccidentalWI @Riverwest Where? What's it called?
Los Campesinos! loud on the ipod + coffee to wake me up. On the last leg of bus ride to class.
First cup of coffee of the day.
I keep forgetting that I'm supposed to mention Dreamhost.
Today was fairly productive.
The Productive Programmer's explanation of metaprogramming & fluent interfaces using Ruby (dynamic langs in general) is the best I've read.
It's 2010, and I still go "Gah, that file was on my laptop, not my desktop." and vice-versa.
@whil maybe next week monday we casn put your DWT on a trailer and pull it with our bikes while we do the #MiMRide. Sounds good?
Thanks again to @littletinyfish, @lukestory & @svdodhe for riding tonight on the #MiMRide. What's the official distance tonight, @svdodge?
Split off from the #mimride pack to head home. Just me, my bike, and a mile or two of empty oak leaf trail.
I just put my resume under version control with git.  I should've done that a long time ago, but didn't take seriously. Tracking changes FTW
@svdodge There's iTRC, but it is terrible. Makes me want to design a decent iPhone Remote.app-inspired UI & learn Obj-C. Real need there.
@svdodge I know. That's @MKEHackerHouse's feature request numero uno for iTunes/Apple.
@svdodge It's @ashedryden's book actually. I just take interesting things from her bookshelf when she's not looking.
@jennaddenda Are you watching streams of some event? Just trying to place that last tweet.
@jennaddenda Where are you?
@whil 50 gigs isn't  bad. Copying all my data (1Tb+) to any web service becomes a little extreme. Do I need to back it all up? Probably not.
When did I get so popular? 24 unread email, and that's after my 6 million filters hide everything unimportant. That's gotta be a record.
@tapps @DDysart This is what I get for telling tall tales.
So *that's* where that book went.
@abraham I'm lucky if I hit 5Mbps in a speed test. Real world usage? Not even close.
@tomatoist I love  thanks for creating it :-)
That's enough monkeying with Twitter color scheme for today.
Making my Twitter profile look good with Themeleon by @COLOURlovers  Love it?
@ashedryden Depends on the project. Generally when coding, I'll commit every edit-save-test cycle. When I blog, it is when I go to publish.
Constantly unsatisfied with my twitter theme colors and my blog's design. Ladies and gentlemen, I have caught designeritus.
@whil It'd be nice, due to the way iTunes works, etc, to not have to carry any external hard drives and yet bring everything with me.
I was so hungry that I made myself a double-decker PB&J sandwich. And that is after the leftover Chinese food from last night.
@zacwitte 
@DDysart Paul Allen came to my town once when I was a little boy. He gave us all fiber internet connections and puppies.
@whil Media files, mostly.
First cup of coffee for the day comes at 11:22AM. Wow. I've been up far too long to not be caffeinated.
Kindle spotting. First one i've seen, strangely enough.
With the same question, you could consider whether the iPad is all hype or whether it really is as "magical" as Jobs said.
Philosophy textbook asks: how do you know what you buy will work as promised? Thinking about netbooks having illusion of being real computer
@smutandeggs There's something to be said about reading the original work of an author rather than derivatives.
Finding it really hard to focus/concentrate tonight.
Introducing: Derek Dysart  on The WI Setup. #theWIsetup
@heygabe Apparently there's a NetStumbler iPhone/iPod touch app. Try that?
7410 tweets. I need to top 10K. That is all.
@schmenzer I think I just saw you on your bike by Watertower Rd & the hospital?
@svdodge you can use minified JavaScripts & make sure Apache is gzipping on the server end to make things smaller. YSlow is your friend.
@littletinyfish Those pictures from your tumblr.. wow.. baggy pants on you.. it's like bizarro-world @littletinyfish.
@DDysart Just remember: if you don't talk to @ashedryden, she can't tumblr you :P
@usesthis I think there's a broken Markdown link tag on  Just spotted that.
@blissdev I can dig it. 
Introducing: Pete Prodoehl on The WI Setup:  #theWIsetup
More caffeine and on the double!
Having one of those "Gah, it's Friday, and I haven't tweeted about @MKEHackerHouse not happening this weekend."
"It's a @raster disaster."
@blakehall Seconded. Piping stuff from a script or a download to the commandline MySQL tool is very powerful.
Rails-using friends: Who isn't excited for Rails 3? 
This coffee is weak.

Netbook (Atom CPU) Macbook Air clone for $260USD? Tempting  if only to peel off the Apple stickers & enjoy 1280x800 LCD.
Continued: Creative geeks tend to talk more about how *well* something works or doesn't work. Coder+creative types blend these, naturally.
Random observation from The WI Setup: coder geeks tend to obsess about the details of hardware. Camera geeks too. #TBC
Once again, for those just getting home from work: @raster on The WI Setup:   #theWIsetup
@svdodge How do you feel about the fit of your Sanwa? Just curious.
Apparently a dual core Atom (the N330) is twice as powerful as my 1.5Ghz PowerPC Powerbook. Sold on replacing Powerbook with the ASUS 1201n.
@raster The Neverending Story, obviously.  Maybe your daughters aren't old enough to remember it fondly, though.
Coffee and coding.
Every time I say "bank," @ashedryden corrects me "It's a CREDIT UNION!"
@joshjs I've always been terrible at that. I take pictures with my digicam, but they're not geotagged, so I don't know which apt is which.
@mariehuynh @rockmanac $700 for 2nd gen 1.6Ghz Macbook Air on milwaukee craigslist; I think it is still available. Not that I can afford it.
So it turns out 2nd gen Macbook Airs can be had cheap on local Craigslist. Nice. If only I wasn't broke.
#svdodge Looks like a fun project to try: 
People need to learn to push their m*therf*cking shopping carts.
Miley Cyrus playing in the grocery store. Make it stop arrrgh.
OH: "I'm tired of talking to you. Yes, i'm hanging up, why don't you go blog about it?" -- lady on phone at the bagel shop, not to me.
@raster re: organic sugar. Yeah. I just found out that most white sugar is bleached with animal "bone char". And that HFCS is made by @Satan
@whil 103F is hot enough to start breaking down the proteins in your brain.
#lazyweb: What should I get for groceries? #vegan, #noHFCS.
@Arlen Ruby!
I need dinner.
my name in inigo monyoya. you killed my father, prepare to die
Gah. Crabby. Blaming (my own) uninspired CSS/design and nothing working.
What do you want to see on my blog? Just curious; looking for topic ideas. Coding practices, BDD, setting up tools/servers/etc, git/scm?
Debating whether I want to stay in+code or go on the #MiMRide tonight. Of course, I have to ride: I'm feeling slow & lethargic (cough:fat)
@abraham Damn. How many free Android phones have you received so far?
OH: Kid telling his parent about why he likes his teacher: "He talks like you and I is doin' right now. Then he gets up on a chair."
Cuties may be the best citrus fruit ever. That is all.
@rockmanac And hackintoshers took away that problem ;)
@smutandeggs I had the Weird Wisconsin book.  was a cool website that inspired it, back in the day, as they say.
@rockmanac Will be dualbooting Linux and Mac OSX hackintoshed. Apparently driver support is good, and the gfx card is nVidia ION (aka 9400M)
@rockmanac I think I'm going to retire the 12" Powerbook for a dual core netbook. Geekbench scores say the Atom N330 is twice as powerful :P
@rockmanac Nice!
@rockmanac My powerbook has survived nearly 5 years now. Crazy. My 12" Powerbook was the last rev before the Macbooks came out.
@rockmanac I'm mostly-mobile so desktops don't make sense for me anymore. On the same vein, I'd rather not fall off my bike & destroy a MBP.
@rockmanac It's an Intel macmini, 1.86Ghz Core Duo (Not Core 2 Duo) Could use something more portable and more powerful than it.
Fun with Regex: Turn Charlie Stross's Accelerando into a story about Merlin Mann and his pal &lt;strike&gt;Bob Franklin&lt;/strike&gt;Cory Doctorow.
@rockmanac How do you like the 13" MBP? Thinking it would be a good replacement for my 12" Powerbook & macmini. Afraid of breaking one, tho.
RT @ashedryden: "And every year I should expect half of what I've learned to become obsolete." - Things I've learned at Google  ...

Still planning to ride tonight (Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride) Anyone else planning to come? #MiMRide
@Lukas_Sparks That ampersand degrades nicely to other fonts' ampersoands if Baskerville isn't present. Was trying to class it up.

Tomorrow is the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride again! Meet 6PM outside Cafe Hollander (Downer Ave) for 2hrs of nice riding before the snow storm!
@joshjs a @joshjs?
New blog post: Book Review — The Productive Programmer 
In other news, Jekyll (static blog generator) still isn't building my blog. Might be hung on some Markdown bug, but it isn't throwing errors
For some reason, when I make pancakes, I think it smells like a log cabin. Dunno why. Just how a log cabin is supposed to smell, in my head.
What's all the Buzz about? ;)
Streets and sidewalks are a mess right now, but it isn't that bad out here.
Jekyll isn't generating new blog posts. No idea why. I deleted the local directory of generated posts/pages. It didn't rebuild them. Gah.
@sixohsix Impromptu research with the Google keyword search says those topics (emacs vs vi, Ruby vs Python, etc) are already well covered.
I'm already running late for Cafe Hollander. Riding through Shorewood.
Post-scarcity communism in Charles Stross's Singularity Sky: "from each according to his imagination, to each according to his needs!"
Neighbor lady is pouring windshield washer fluid on sidewalk instead of shoveling. I think we have competition for @svdodge's crazy neighbor
@whil There's also bike-math, which I recently brought up with my Differential Equations professor. Gear ratios, tire sizes, gear-inches etc
@whil geek-centric stuff? (mounting an iPhone/GPS) or general repair/conversion / bike repair knowledge?
Predicting Google Buzz is a ghost town in the space of 4 months.
Also would be keen on doing a session with someone on BDD/TDD or continuous integration servers. It's never too early to start planning ;)
Future BarCampeMKE session ideas (vote by @reply) More git, Ruby on Rails 3, Shoes/HacketyHack, hacking Roombas, intro to jQuery, bike hacks
@whil The reason they're struggling so much in the photos is that they're riding heavy mountain bikes w/ momentum-sucking suspension forks.
@ckittel I know that Thoughtworks' popular Cruisecontrol comes in a .NET flavor. Don't know anything about nUnit or anything like that.
@ckittel If I put up a small wiki with my notes on BDD/TDD & continuous integration servers, would you throw some .NET stuff on there?
btw @web414: I was wrong last night. It's trivial to add an image diff program to a git repo's config to diff image files.
Starting with an empty iTunes music library. Snappy!
Awesome Bonjour-enabled Git web interface (adhoc Github basically)  I'll set up a Git server with this at the next BCMKE.
Homebrew is the bee's knees. I would recommend it over Macports now.
@chernowa  Ruby is very forgiving and sensible to start learning, but it has powerful features when you're ready for them.
@chernowa Start at the beginning, with Ruby if you don't know it. That said, Rails is basically a domain-specific language for web apps.
@matthusby Yeah, looking at Heroku for this project. Their free plan will probably work fine. A Small Orange has a nice cheap plan too.
Anyone have suggestions for Ruby (Rails, Rack, etc) hosting plans on the cheap?
Top 100 Websites list from 1999: 
Using my interview from The WI Setup to remember what software to install on Snow Leopard 
Using homebrew instead of MacPorts on the new Snow Leopard install. Liking it so far.
Got a new winter bike from my dad. Flat black hot rod.
Snow Leopard installed on a blanked macmini. Cross your fingers that it works better now!
I am wiping my macmini and starting from a clean Snow Leopard install.
I am using a 15" Macbook Pro for the first time (not just borrowing for a minute.) I'm struck by how fast it is and how nice the trackpad is
@heygabe my notes aren't great but at least they're a record of /something/
Integrity server on my laptop is hosed for some reason. All the more reason I need a new laptop.
New blog post: 
Potential band name: the unfortunate font choices
Current inflation negates savings accounts, right?
@pixelbud Yeah my mistake was upgrading to Snow Leopard from Tiger and skipping the Leopard update step. Need to wipe & reinstall SL.
@corbenfrost Compound interest rate derivatives yeaaaaaaaaaaaaah.
@littletinyfish going afterward
@svdodge going to web414 tonight?
iTunes feature request that I've wanted since day 1 in iTunes: use the iTunes Music Store genre for this album to set the genre correctly.
Coffee was so necessary.
@pixelbud In this case there wasn't anything to kill, and even using the start/stop/restart scripts weren't helping. System was hosed.
OH: "Curl up with an integral this weekend for Valentine's Day. This is a guaranteed interesting problem if your SO isn't so interesting."
Buzz is a four letter word, that's all I heard, call me stupid or absurd, but to me, coming from you, Buzz is a four letter word.
@blissdev My macmini on Snow Leopard has been doing this. The Finder won't relaunch, either.  Force quit doesn't fix it. Only reboot works.
@chernowa Batter Blaster.
Making pancakes from a spray can. We truly live in the future.
@ashedryden's cat Taffer stepped on my keyboard and ended up registering @tafferinspace. Check it out.
Bike ride covered my new backpack & jacket in road grime+slush. Winter bike needs fenders.
Just cleared out my oldest working flashdrive. 1 gig total. Some files had a last opened date of 2005. Backed it up, obviously.
Invariably, the peanut butter toast landed peanut butter side down. It is one of those days.
@narkalant Probably not relevant to your current location, but the Pledge Fabric Sweeper for Pet Hair works wonders compared to the 3M thing
Debating whether I should go for a bike ride or not.
"mind-numbingly clever."
Moar Alterra!
@Narkalant This thing:  came with refill sheets that I could probably fab a Roomba roller out of.
@ashedryden made yummy vegan cookies!
At Caribou Coffee with @blissdev and @ashedryden.
@corbenfrost A fine compliment. Thank you.
@Narkalant but I'd recommend the Pledge over the 3M Fur Fighter thing, fo sho.
Walking to Bucketworks
The National bakery has good music. Really good music.
Heading to The National bakery to meet up wiith @jeffmke for lunch.
I think me being on a laptop rather than a lab computer is making the lab attendant nervous. Keep getting a flyby back here in the corner.
Tonight is the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride! Meet at 6PM outside Cafe Hollander on the East Side. Dress warm! Thinking about riding to Bayview.
Another week, another new interview with Jason Gessner  on The WI Setup! Hot off the presses!

Booting up.
My first gray hair. I'm old :(
Missed the 10 by half a block again. Need to work on my 100 meter dash.
Doing a "killall java" is so satisfying.
Really nice day outside. Biking to Bucketworks would probably be faster and more fun than this bus. Missed both my buses so far, hrm.
Doing taxes in the morning.
My pants' zipper broke while I was at #SuperSecretInternship. Didn't want them to think I was weird. Embarrassing yet funny, in retrospect.
@AJBombers  I was with the Groupcard guys; you didn't miss me. No worries.
Heading to @AJBombers.
At bucketworks. Still settling in.
The people on the bus have Alterra coffee, and it smells good. I don't have any coffee this morning.
Morning read while I drink coffee:  Learnimacation!
@joshjs @streetzapizza You guys must be popular or something.
Missing @ashedryden a lot.
Still feeling blah, so I'm making white rice, chickpeas, and peas. Indian-inspired without any of the spices.
Home from the Bike Collective. Cold, sick, too nauseous to be hungry. Ugh.
Down at the MKE bike collective.
Also: Merino socks clean up floors better than a Roomba.
I did it all for the Merino, yeah, the Merino, yeah, the Merino, so you can take those Chinos, and shove them up your..
@svdodge @raster do it! Snow Leopard FTW!
Sometimes using the filetype: operator on Google Search saves so much time.
I think I have jetlag.
Good morning world.

 - Fuck yeah Bananajour time!
Due to a hilarious typo, I will now fill out all "When were you born?" forms online with the year 1896.
@ashedryden should be taking off any minute.
Down to the bare essentials of Mac OS X software on fresh Snow Leopard install: 
Home late. Missed @ashedryden before her flight. Kind of bummed about that. Phone is completely dead and lost the charger. Damn.
I'll own up to having become re-addicted to Lost.
New game: How many tabs can I open in Google Chrome on Mac OSX? Turns out, a whole heck of a lot.
@tapps Down by the lakefront where UWM wanted to build, wasn't that an old restaurant? Proximity to Discovery World and downtown is a plus.
@joshjs greatestfatherever.com isn't, (after hearing the phrase in Lost, I had to check. Might register that and put Ben Linus's dad on it)
@zacwitte They're coming for you, Neo, and I don't know what they're going to do.
Changing the tires on my winter bike to some kenda kross plus's (thanks again @svdodge for those!)
@Oshuma Just found the source on github for Tomatoi.st  win
Orange-ginger-pumpkin muffin-bread turned out good. Kinda pumpkin pie-ish on the inside.
@Oshuma The only thing I wish  did was let me set a name for the Pomodoros in the log and mark it 'complete' or 'abandoned'
My paper about metaphysics and reality uses the Beatles song "Tomorrow Never Knows." Yeah.
The 4 Agreements of the Aztecs: Be Impeccable with Your Word; Don't Take Anything Personally; Don't Make Assumptions; & Always Do Your Best.
Time to Pomodoro my way through homework: 
@ashedryden I've been secretly wanting a photographer/tactical vest for years now. With a builtin supercomputing cluster. Blame Accelerando.
@jeffmke Riding tomorrow night? I've gotta throw some new tires and change the saddle on my new winter bike tonight before the ride.
Tomorrow night is the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride! Hoping to get some riders. Snow showers forecasted. 6PM outside Cafe Hollander (Downer Ave)
@raster But visually comparing two image files would be kinda cool.
@raster Well, git would know that. It actually uses an SHA1 hash of the contents of objects to name commits.
@svdodge Related-to-my-last-tweet: I want to set up git to manage photos & configure an image diff program. We need to do this sometime.
I'm getting a headstart on my git session for the next BarCampMilwaukee. Ask me your questions here:  #git
 - Anyone else having this problem in the Snow Leopard dock? All my application icons disappeared.
Playing with MongoDB while the muffin-bread bakes. 
I made my own vegan version of Alterra's cran-orange muffins. Actually orange-cocoa-pumpkin muffinbread. because I didn't have a muffin pan.
#lazyweb: Since 'velcro' is a trademarked term, can I use it as the name of an open source project? I assume not. #legal
Keeping everything in git on my new machine, including my .config files in my home directory. We'll see how that goes.
Science rap autotweet: 
Good morning headache.
I haven't blogged in forever. Gah.
Looks like it's time to go to Philadelphia and kick some asses.
WHY AM I SHOPPING ON HOOKEDONPHONICS.COM WHY
Looks like fun 
Guy has a nexus one on the bus and he's explaining how it is better than the iphone to some other guy. Interesting.
Wondering if this headache is worse because of the Diet Coke I'm drinking.
@littletinyfish Maybe some time later this week? Gotta adjust the brakes on my winter bike.
I think my laptop is melting. too many compiles going on at once. (Wait, aren't we a PHP shop? Why am I compiling anything?!?)
@joshjs congrats!
@jeffmke @svdodge OK. I won't be riding tonight, sorry to anyone who considered #MiMRide. Someone else is more than welcome to run it tho.
Anyone actually want to go on the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride tonight? I may end up having to cancel for myself. #MiMRide
Dear laptop: START WORKING. kthx, @mathiasx
@ashedryden There is plenty more at home!
@ashedryden is back and everything is right in the world.
Bike ride complete. Winter bike with semislick tires (running way over mtn bike tire pressure) is fast and nimble.
Winter bike test ride on new tires & new saddle. Did a lot of cleaning and washed some floors. Now i get to ride as a reward :)
Who knew that changing tires was such a messy task?
Twitter OAuth development. Yay.
Focus follows mouse is annoying. How about "Focus follows what I'm looking at"
OH: "Pizza is bridge-able."
@svdodge Citrus Strip!
@svdodge Old locks are always awesome. Gotta love tarnished brass and old copper.
I am officially phone support now.
I think it says something when i leave before @ashedryden and shev gets to work in Cedarburg faster than I can get to 6th & State on the bus
@raster The beatings will continue until moral improves.
@ckittel Really could use a ProjectManagementCamp unconference. Would love to spend a day getting immersed into all sorts of ideas.

Getting flipped off by people going by, while standing at a bus stop, in a snow storm. I love you too, Milwaukee.
@DDysart My Macbook optimizes the fireball all the time. I mean, err, beachball.
That's a decent amount of snow falling.
"Optimize the fireball" can be the new battlecry of geeks everywhere: 
@ashedryden Taking credit for coming up with this idea.
@smutandeggs 3/14 is Pi day. I plan to make a Pi pie.
OH: "Dead companies can't afford automatic martini makers."
Planning to build a MAME Arcade slash kegerator.
@ckittel Lastly, 
@ckittel The other problem is that most management methods are designed to manage people who can't manage themselves. Responsible people FTW
@ckittel I distrust "must do something for it to count." "Must use this software" "must run meetings this way" "must timeblock this way" etc
 - morning anime hair. I look pretty terrible.
@ckittel I like geeking out about methods that have their own complete "system." It's like learning an RPG. Leading others is still hard.
Reasons to hate Walmart: stale bread, if you eat a less-popular brand; expired soymilk (they only carry one brand of it)
@heygabe that may work for you, though.
@heygabe MacFusion has an SSH/SFTP filesystem mount. But I don't like that solution. I need a log of uploads/downloads, timestamps, etc.
Jettisoned as much out of my laptop backpack as possible.  Still way too heavy. I don't bring textbooks (teacher's packet covers everything)
Stupid MAMP.

@Arlen Lansing is far and I don't have a car, or else I'd be looking into it. #GreatLakesRubyBash.
Oh, btw, that's snow. You guys remember how to drive when it is snowing, right? No? Sucks to be you!
@jennaddenda I think I may have to bring a guitar to Bucketworks. Or a ukelele. For songs inbetween uploads.
1 hour 45 minutes later, I'm home.
Apparently iPhoto didn't install on teh fresh Snow Leopard install because it is sold as part of iLife now. Gah. Was so used to using it.
Sidewalks are all slick ice in Riverwest :/
how my house will get clean in the future: a parade of little robots.
@ashedryden Good luck honey &lt;3
*sarcasm* It's great that you broke up your 2 page-length HOWTO into 10 linked pages. Now I have to load in tabs before I'm stuck offline.
Going to be in the car all night. Bringing laptop. You know what that means? git-svn checkout a fresh copy of project & start coding!
So that was cool.
@DrCrypt My Powerbook's battery takes about an hour to charge from dead. Although, it contains a lot less mAhs than this laptop's battery.
Macbook quirk: It was unplugged overnight and battery ran down to 88% while closed. Charging from 88% to full is estimated to take an hour.
@svdodge That Peugeot is a real beauty, too.
@jeffmke @svdodge 95 here. And I don't even watch TV or anything. Heh.
Ugh.
Hammer + hammer = bigger hammer!
Heating up the wheel assembly/brake with a torch. FIRE GOOD.
I'm not at the milwaukee bicycle collective today because we're in Toledo. Yeah. Not quite as awesome as the mke bicycle collective.
The soap where we're staying is not vegan. (contains yogurt) o_O
I spent the state of Indiana (and into Ohio now) reading the Facebook Platform PHP5 Client. Hoping to shore up my PHP knowledge this weekend
Drinking gas station coffee. Every sip makes me feel a little closer to death.
Passed Fail Road twice in Indiana.
I take that back. The *only* things we've seen in Indiana tonight are billboard ads. They don't have anything else here. It is a wasteland.
Ah, i'm beginning to understand Indiana. They have pop-up ads full of Mesothelioma spam.
We just saw a truck carrying another truck. @ashedryden & I immediately started saying "We herd you liek trucks..."
Passing O'Hare. Glad not to be going there.
Car hacking. Sparks everywhere. We're modifying our tools. Must get this done.
Putting together a 6 ton hydraulic press.
Still in Ohio. No end in sight.
It's 106 miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank of gas, a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses. Hit it.
Teaching the girl at this oasis's coffee shop to make a red eye. She's never heard of it. Not a Starbucksl, mind.
Get me to a state where I can eat. Still waiting to have lunch.
Btw, we fixed the car and we're headed back to Wisconsin.
More oxy torches. Fire good!
@mariehuynh Some favorites:    I've heard good things about 
@mariehuynh I'm a fan of strong breakfast teas and Earl Greys, but haven't had enough authentic Chinese black tea to know how I like those.
@aaronsaray git would be faster than svn for binary files. You can tell git to use an image diff tool for JPGs/gifs/etc, or open Photoshop.
Funny how after you've had really amazing black tea, Lipton's Brisk tea (from a teabag) tastes like playdough.
@jeffmke good luck. looks beautiful out, but I'm too busy to make it.
@ashedryden Technically, it is not "rocket science," it is aerospace engineering.
Just walked by a class on computer networking (or repair) and heard an explanation of netmasks that was so basic & wrong that I cringed.
Does anyone want to take over the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride for the time being? Really busy with school. DM me and let me know. thanks!
It has been a long weekend.
Exhausted. Haven't been online in 2 days. I can't remember what I am supposed to do online anymore. facebook? twitter? read blogs? hah!
The characters in the Final Fantasy XIII commercial look like emo kids.
Setting up Windows XP VM for web dev testing. Suggestions for stuff I should install? IE6, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Selenium. Anything else?
@joshjs That's just begging for all your followers to DM you, you know?
Yes, I did just Google Image search for a picture of myself. I probably should've gone straight to flickr, though.
Getting into a groove with handling support tickets now. Need to start working some metrics on these to make sure I'm improving at it.
I think I'm gonna fall asleep now.
@heygabe This needs to be made possible. Possibly involving a wiimote.
Guy who never saw Lost, blogging about the last season: "The island is some sort of vacation destination that you get to via plane crash."
@nikulr I checked my answers. Fairly confident. I didn't have certain derivatives 100% memorized, but those were just steps towards answers.
@ashedryden I know a thing or two, believe it or not.
Since I stopped using iTunes to store my music and the macmini has been relegated to network media server, I've listened to a lot less mp3's
The KIRF section of engadget is always pure gold. 
@jeffmke My lungs tend to hurt in the bitter cold, even after half an hour.
I could really go for some Indian food right now.
@jeffmke how did the ride go last night?
Test today went well. I can feel it.
@ashedryden Seconded. Ibuprofen got me moving this morning despite caffeine withdrawal.
Thanks to the miracle of Calc3 homework, I am just now going to bed.
Mke winter cyclists: warning, sidewalks on the north side of the holton marsupial bridge is all slick ice/snow. Both sidewalks all the way.
Also, just hit the 150 API requests/hour ceiling. Need to get whitelisted, next.
Code is officially talking to Twitter via OAuth API. Pleased.
Note to self: get fenders. Muddy road grime puddles down by the lake.
Biking to Bucketworks on my winter bike. Taking the scenic route along the lakehshore.
Architecture antipattern: putting the thermostat on the wall three feet above the oven in the kitchen.
@littletinyfish Because they can't handle the truth!
@svdodge going to do the same today. sunny day bike rides ftw.
@MarcLyon Except they don't publish the Computer Acceptable Use Policy anywhere on their website according to Google. Lame.
@MarcLyon Actually I thought it'd be funny to get MATC.edu blocked here by finding something on their site that violates the policy.

This tweet brought to you by Nostalgia, from Adrian Veidt.
Did my best Starscream impression for @ashedryden and she got the reference. She's a keeper.
Now taking suggestions for stunning desktop background images.
had to give my Chrome Kursk shoes a febreeze bath when I got home and wipe off all the road grime. MKE road grime + being Cordura = smelly.
Showered. Going out to dinner. Jazzed because I was productive coding today. Actually looking forward to cranking out some homework later.
Had a pleasant ride. Some guy declined help with his thrown chain on Water Str.
Mmm Blue Sky Jamaican Ginger Ale. (No HFCS)
@jeffmke If I recover from this cold, I will definitely be biking on Monday. Overwhelming schedule is settling out nicely.
@svdodge @jeffmke I understand how it hurts businesses. I manage my money better when I work on a cash system. I just never take $ out.
At the Riverwest Coop.
@jeffmke *nods*
@jeffmke I don't have checks and my credit union is nowhere nearby. Kind of silly to turn away customers, in any case.
I am too sick to brain today.
@chernowa I agree. They can even have a minimum order. At Fuel Cafe, etc, $5 is the minimum.
Walked 7 blocks to try a soup place. They don't take debit cards, so pointed me at an ATM. $5 fee for $5 of soup?! I'll pass, thanks.
I think I caught the Toledo Superbug.
@ashedryden me too :-(
The intersection of Layton and Forest Home and the freeway offramo has to be one of the worst civil engineering designs in Milwaukee.
@svdodge I've got family in town and enough supplies to get through this quarantine. Thanks for the offer, though!
I think I fell asleep for a few hours this afternoon. I can't remember. Too sick.
Fitting. "I Will Follow You Into the Dark" by Death Cab for Cutie came on Last.fm after I finished 
I have amassed a nice little collection of empty cans, coffee mugs, and glasses next to my on the coffee table. Hydrated? you betcha.
@raster I need to get a copy of that. Samples sound neat on Amazon.
I have been neglecting my blog. As soon as the next round of math tests is over, I'm starting a series of posts introducing git usage.

@svdodge Nice!

Officially in self-imposed quarantine. The #ToledoSuperbug sucks.
I think my brain just melted.
Brown rice, black beans, quinoa and corn. Superfood vegan lunch!
Google Chrome says it is blocking pop-ups but they're playing annoying flash ads. So much for blocking, Chrome. Lame.
My mom needs to get an iPhone already. She owns a GPS but doesn't use it, and she has trouble txting on her phone (the Tony Stark phone)

Even sicker this morning. Grossness.
@abraham You probably don't want to know.
Headcolds suck.
@gregtarnoff It's Linux, it should run like a champ. Ubuntu Server doesn't use X11, even.
Who are you and what are you doing in my house?
@gregtarnoff Ubuntu Server? 
Stuffing my pocket with a huge wad of kleenex and hand sanitizer. Still really sick with this cold.
Sneezing
I think the last time I wore this particular outfit, I was going to my grandmother's funeral. That was a couple years ago, now.
Vitamin C, better fix me, alright?
Watch this one with HD on. 
Flickr no longer work within frames, so it doesn't display in Google Image Search. Not awesome.
@ashedryden I have a sore throat. That's how I sound now.
Still sick. Yuck.
I have a fever, and the only cure is more cowbell.
My nose is draining like Niagara Falls. I know you all wanted to know that. #StillSick.
@gregtarnoff At least he didn't win it for being The Plague in Hackers. Heh. That movie rocked so hard. &gt;.&gt;
@antifuchs Yeah, @ashedryden is using gitx currently.
@jennaddenda We're trying to pick the next book to read here, too. I'm having a hard time sticking with one.
@mariehuynh usb flash drives are super cheap, too.
Compiled GitNub.app to try it out for @ashedryden. It's a pretty OSX git log viewer / gitk. She's looking for a commit tool, I guess.
The most overdone tattoos right now are: My Little Ponies, Golden Snitch, ee cummings, Perks of being a Wallflower quotes, birds, octopuses.
Adopting a manatee. Save the planet and all.
@svdodge Our first PC had a keyboard like that. Might've been unusually soft plastic, but the spacebar started to wear down & keys smoothed
@svdodge @JoeSteve I may not make it after all. A short nap after class and I'm still not feeling that great.
@jeffmke I'm gonna take DayQuil and try to ride. I'm in poor shape right now, though.
Don't tell anyone, but I actually enjoying styling things with CSS.
We're mathematicians. When the going gets tough, we draw right triangles.
Making fun of Toledo in class.
@abraham Is that why you geotagged the photo? to show people where to break in?
Plocky's chips with Salpica Corn & Black Bean Salsa. So damn tasty that I fixed a huge bug in code while I ate a whole jar without realizing
Don't you love when the bug you thought was in your code was just caused by a directory on the webserver not having the right permissions?
When will this cold end? Gah. Yes, #StillSick.
I guess there's an Association for Computing Machinery SIGSCE conference going on at the Midwest Airlines Center right now, across the s ...
Headed to Bucketworks, on the bus.
Do you #bikewithgoogle? I need to get a smartphone that can do GMaps and a bike mount, apparently..
@ashedryden Kringle!
Soaked. Awesome.
Freezing in the rain, waiting for a bus.
Update: #StillSick. :-(
OH: "You're a bad influence on all my children." :-/
In a meeting (?!?)
I should be doing some homework before @web414. Then again. Naaaaah.
HTML emails: the last hold-out of table-based design. Yuck.
Twitter is down, so doing Twitter app dev right now is a little frustrating.
@chernowa It'll even tweet about it for you automatically if you want.
@chernowa It's a Mac OSX taskbar tool that lets you drop just about anything on it (screenshots, code snippets, etc) and get a URL to share.
Just started using Droplr, an app for Mac. Check it out at 
We're all gushing about new-to-us  over here.
@svdodge Are you coming to Web414 tonight?
Nasty out there today.

@joshjs potential band name: the chuck norris bacon lost burrito experience
Really want to get over this cold so I can go back to riding bikes next week. In other news, #stillSick.
&gt;.&lt;
@svdodge Motorbike, technically. I truncated for twitter's 140 chars and thought it was funny.
Pet peeve: When people start talking about "riding a bike," but they mean motorcycle, and I mean bicycle. I ride a bike, they ride a mike.
I realized my blogging setup is totally fubar on the new machine. Oops.
@svdodge I'm still trying to get over the horror of playing ChatRoulette at web414 last night. Pete and Gabe scare me, a lot.
RT @youphoric: This year, Wisconsin actually has a season between Winter and Summer. It's called Fog&Shit
half of the audience tonight is on the panel. #web414 @web414.
Naked men, only at @web414.
The smallest web414 ever? Hurray, get on down to @bucketworks!
Twitter direct messages aren't being sent by my app's code. Time to investigate.

@svdodge wants dean kamen & dyson to get together and build rosie from the jetsons.
Checking in at Classic Slice in Bayview #notFoursquare.
Apparently all I'm capable of today is pissing people off about nothing. :/ I should give up on today.
@joshjs Do you want company at Classic Slice tonight?
Today was bust for bride's maid dresses. Now I won't get to be the prettiest girl there.
We've been to three separate shopping center areas (in Glendale, Brookfield, & now Brown Deer) and they're all unwalkable, generic & boring.
Starbucks. It's been years since I've been to one.
This place is definitely not pedestrian friendly. Stupid auto-centric spersawl.
Random idea: Rock Band: Shower edition. Waterproof speaker + microphone + Journey.
@songza Thanks. I love songza.org :)
I wonder if there's a Chrome extension to block Youtube comments. I need one.
Blip.fm is broken, lala.com complains about ClicktoFlash (loads music in the background), Songza is gone.. Where should I listen to music?
OH: "I think you're a very smart man. " "Well, you're an idiot. You were useless in that room."

It's a Monday! That means it is time for another exciting round of the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride! Meet 6PM outside Cafe Hollander on Downer.

I didn't think I had my iPod for the bus ride, but i just looked in my bag for a coughdrop & found it. Extreme win!
@gregtarnoff hooray for riding bikes. I will be cycling tonight, as well. Hoping this cold finally goes away.
Yesterday was easy. This morning, the daylight saving time hit me like a brick.
OH: "You violated your body for me. i'm so honored!"
@raster KISS ME I'M A PIRATE?
I just read "Altruism? From you?" as "Autism? From you?" I'm a little tired, ok?
So that works.
Spilled coffee on my coffee-stained shirt. &gt;.&lt;
The AC is on in the bus today. hah.
I've completely lost my voice.
I just coughed up a small bird worth of grossness. #stillSick, still gross.
Feeling great after eating a huge pot of soup.
@sawaboof Nice to see you out on the ride tonight. I'm an introvert, too! (and I was kind of winded from still being sick)
Awesome Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride! Thanks everyone!
Just spilled Rishi loose leaf tea everywhere. Gah!
Only took 1.5hrs to get home :/
@gregtarnoff Then set up local dev and run your own version control.
@gregtarnoff Abandon Dreamweaver, embrace a text editor and Firefox+Firebug
Have yet to use @Droplr despite its awesome functionality. Just haven't had to make any screenshots or share anything (files, URLs, etc)
Nice spring day.
Having a much better day now that I got out of class, got some coffee and am hanging out with @ashedryden.
Bus is very late, very full & rynning a detour route. Early for class becomes late for class. Also, North Ave is all tore up.
Me: "Did you eat your soup?" Ashe: "I had one bite!" Me: "You can't bite it, it's pureed."

I want to relax, but I've got homework to churn through. Maybe I'll read for my Philosophy class instead.

OH: "Banana Drill? Banana Drill!"
Seriously though. We could be the Makerbot ( of Lab-on-Chip devices. Who wants in? #biotechStartup in #mke.
@ashedryden The problem is how Drupal does REST, I think. Getting the plaintext content and POSTing the changed fields isn't a trivial task?
@ashedryden Garrison Keillor is not country music. It's Minnosota/Lutheran COMEDY gold.
That sounds about right: 
@mtbvegan That's part of her solution. My point being that I'm pretty sure I had a sinus infection, which is gone, and it's now in my lungs.
@svdodge totally agree with your blog post. I've tried to convey to @ashedryden how some people forget there's an actual PERSON on a bike.
Based on my Dr's visit, I'm thinking about the definite need for cheap, fast lab-on-chip tests. Anyone want to do a biotech startup in MKE?
The doctor doesn't think I was ever sick. She just thinks I have bad allergies. At this rate, I'll never get better.
I will finally be going to the doctor today.
My lungs are filling up with evil.

Slow takeoff. Yes, it is rocket science.
A morning with @ashedryden spent showing off bash shell commands and working with git commands. #awesomeGirlfriend.
An unintended side-effect of Foursquare's popularity is that I keep learning where businesses in Milwaukee are, when I click to see the map.
@DDysart I figured. @zefrank is a personal hero, so I definitely need to watch that.
Snow!
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say: TED Talk videos &gt; SXSWi videos.
OH: "It's like I have pants where my legs should go."
A new idea, brimming with potential, and I get bogged down in configuring the dev environment and deciding on names. Bah humbug.
OH: "I'm not responsible for the horribleness that may result."
@ashedryden: "This cake is really sugary." Me: "All gone! Watch me freak out now!"
Am I the only person that finds The Daily Show annoying? Especially when it's background noise? (I think they amplify the audience laughter)
I think the fact that I can choose the timezone "America/Dawson_Creek" is some kind of cruel joke that the POSIX time people put in there.
So that broke everything. good thing it was a dev environment!
Just made these:  see my notes at the bottom before you try them.
@mojombo Thanks!
So, this happened: 
95 tweets to go until 8K. I don't tweet much. @ashedryden has over 10K already, and she's had two twitter accounts in the time I've had 1.
Going to invent a robot named T-P41N and have it ramble around my house in a top hat, singing "Shawty" and autotuning ambient audio.
@ashedryden I'm not a hipster. Hipsters are lame.
i have to say, not impressed by Alice in 3D. everything was blurry.
@vybeauregard No but it covers the Tao of Pooh.

@heygabe There's just a lot of generalizing. Prof's favorite phrase is "Well, we don't understand this" assuming white, Christian, straight.

Had to get my packable windbreaker out for this morning. Too warm for a winter jacket here now.
423 days and counting.
@svdodge Finders keepers, I guess. If you like them and want to use them.
@joshjs Just curious, what do you like about it? :P
Tomorrow night is another Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride! Forecast predicts 50 degrees! Meet 6PM outside Cafe Hollander on Downer for a 2 hr ride
@svdodge I do! I have more recipes on my old laptop and on my macmini's ext drive. I need to mark them up with Markdown & add to GitHub.
@mariehuynh WebGoat is the computer security/exploit simulator, isn't it?
Cold & windy downtown. Lovely.
Can I please get Enrique Iglesias out of my head? Thanks.
Taking off from Bucketworks to go on the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride tonight. Hoping to see lots of folks tonight! 6PM outside Cafe Hollander.

@1800Postcards Just curious, what do you guys personally use as your business cards?
@1800Postcards thanks. I may have to take you up on that offer :-)
@corbenfrost Actually, it is. I have to order some business cards. Or make them myself. Hmm.
@corbenfrost You could call it that, yes.
Sometimes it pays off to be the local expert in something.

Last.fm tag 'awesome' radio for the morning: 
@aaronsaray Talked to @matthusby and @jsadowski about Facebook Connect this morning: Facebook JS lib drops the cookie, so it needs to load.
I live in a world of constant browsing switching, so my password has become the Password Reset Email link.
Goood morning, first pot of coffee is gone. time for more coffee!
@aaronsaray Or redirect to the actual page if they are there, to prevent loading too much.
@aaronsaray An idea would be to test for cookies existing & redirect the header to load again if they aren't there. Don't echo before that.
Do what I say, not what I do.
10+ groups waiting on the list to get a table at Comet, of course.
Yes. I did just go all the way to Shorewood on the bus to get my fixie. To ride it to Comet.. Ride to @svdodge's from shorewood: 8mins.
I have more layers on than a photoshop painting. (thankyou, i'll be here all night)

@radiomaru The whole point of the Scott Pilgrim was the videogame/comic book violence as well as videogame references mixed into the story.

Looking up @ashedryden's tweets to remember how to make tasty pasta sauce.
@raster I like it. Keep going.
To beat the classic Rails screencast of a blog in 15 minutes, I made DSL named Blarg that needs 1 line of code to start a blog: blarg :title
@raster "I'm Pete! I like Perl! I have the world's oldest blog! RED cameras! HFCS! Star Wars! Creative Commons!" You're easy to impersonate.
Sad because I ground this coffee too coarse and it is weaksauce.
I've got a new The WI Setup interview to mark up. Only I just realized thatt my blog is all on my old laptop. Never cloned the git repo over
At home, coughing up a lung. That wind is killer. Was riding into it the entire time. Bike ride to Bucketworks after lunch, if the wind dies
Biking to class then work today :D
@svdodge Let me know how you like it. We use quinoa quite a bit. It helps rice not taste so bland.
Biking home wasn't as bad as biking to Comet.
@tapps Jealous. I love Steel Train.
@svdodge & I are mapping out Obama's 2nd term's big bill: free smartphones are a basic human right along with clean water & healthcare.
I need to get a wallet with an ID window for my bus pass. #todo
Listening to @jennaddenda 's music across an empty @bucketworks.
@chernowa I have low(er than normal) blood pressure and tend to freeze if I'm not moving. Biking in warm hat + gloves + wool socks helps.
Addendum: Friday is a busy day for spammers spamming our support system, too.
Friday is a busy day for support tickets, I guess.
RT @enzenhofer: using google chrome and then returning FF is the same feeling like 3 years ago, using FF and returning to IE
Adding the "switchies" clause to the Constitution.
I guess I should've mentioned the broken thing sooner.
@ashedryden I grabbed a bag of the @bucketb's tortilla chips because I haven't eaten anything else today. Just coffee. That counts, right?
It's actually not so windy down here in Walker's Point / Fifth Ward. Kinda wish I had biked down.
On the bus to Bucketworks. My legs didn't have the strength to ride against the wind anymore.
@chernowa In fact, I was overdressed! Sweaty now.
@chernowa 36 is plenty warm for a bike ride!
Weather.com lied. It is beautiful outside :-) and warm too!
@joshjs Are these songs about Evangeline in recent years all caused by Evangeline Lilly?
And the 2 Eighth Inch tools I left at the MKE Bike Collective weren't on any of the benches last time I checked, so I guess those grew legs.
Bike tools I've lost: Pedro's Trixie Tool, Eighth Inch multitool, & tire levers. Pretty sure they're around, just not in my bag.
My merino wool zip-up smells like Comet. Which is kinda nasty, the day after.
Biking to the Library, grabbing lunch to bring to work, then either biking or busing down to Bucketworks depending on how cold it is.
Shaving off nearly a month of beard takes longer than I remember. Or maybe I just need a sharper razor.
@littletinyfish I just know more than GMaps does about the relative awesomeness of the Oak Leaf to get to Summerfest and into 3rd Ward.
@littletinyfish 30 minutes from RW to 5th & National is still a good estimation on their part. The routes they suggest are decent, too.
Google Maps bicycling directions are highly confused about how to get on the Oak Leaf. Adds an hour onto the trip up to Hampton & back down.
Need a Netflix Watch Instantly movie suggestion.

Comet Cafe's vegan salisbury steak was necessary. Feel a lot better.
Making bread!
Wish I had a little front basket on my bike, like this:   Need to carry more stuff to @ashedryden's.
@hypnagogic I am a big fan of headphones, too.
I have the craziest hair in crazytown.
I'm no good at being a salesman.
Just drained an alterra xlarge red eye in one big gulp because i'm running late for the mke bike collective & my bike doesn't have a cup ...
Aired up my tires for Spring. They were really low.
@svdodge i'm gonna bike down as well. But i dont know when. Have to go grab coffee first.
@antifuchs send me a link when you're ready to share that. I'm really curious to see it :-)
@ashedryden and I are making a big list of all the food we eat while we watch No Impact Man. Next step: figure out how much we can buy local
@devmke Do I count?
Misheard lyrics: "why would you lie about how much code you had? Why would you lie about something dumb like that?" (vampire weekend)
The bread I baked is super tasty!
@ashedryden is telling me there's more food I can't eat. I'm already vegan, I might as well eat air!
Introducing: John December on The WI Setup:  #theWISetup
Need caffeine. Too broke to buy more coffee beans. Will debug IE CSS/JS errors for coffee.
We decided not to bake the bread tonight. The good news is there's blog posts claiming that refrigerated bread dough has more complex flavor
@mariehuynh No basket on the back. Sure, it'd be more practical, but the small front basket is classier.
Even after cleaning the oven, it is still smoking on preheat attempt number 2. Not exactly awesome.
@svdodge Protip: clean inside the oven while you're at it. It's like the sonic fence to keep the Black Smoke Monster away.
Turns out @ashedryden's oven had some stuff in the bottom from the last time it was used. Burned when the oven heated up. We're both fine.
It's scary how fast the apartment filled with smoke.
I turned on the oven and it filled the apartment with smoke. Couldn't see a thing!
I got some whistler tips on the Macbook's slot CD drive. @kevron @jennaddenda
OHing the board meeting for a Wordpress-based site. Funny how little they know about how websites work. 30+ min on how to post to Wordpress.

I guess it is just me for the #MiMRide tonight.
So yeah, you're all #doinItWrong.
@svdodge Take care.
@svdodge Smiles are all in the eyes.
Trying to move and then climb a 32 foot ladder. What could go wrong?

It's you! It's me! It's dancing! (Los Campesinos!)
Working late at Bucketworks. But I keep scouring Tumblr for music to listen to. So not so much working as listening to @smutandegg's tumblr.
@nikulr Good luck then!
OH: "Maybe SkyNet kept the people on Atlantis, and the lost island of Atlantis is Lost."
@nikulr determinant on a 4x4 matrix where you cross out a row&column and use a 2x2. I blanked on that for a few minutes.
@nikulr I predict my grade on this test will be better than my last one or my last Calc3 test grade.
@nikulr It wasn't too bad. Just take your time and check what you can (by substituting back into the original problem.) And know matrices.
@nikulr Study those y'' + 16y + 4 = e^8t problems *cough cough*
Some kind of crazy.. Lemon cookie... thing.
Someone DM me the closest veggie-friendly grocery store near either marquette u or 5th&national. need to get lunches.

Trying Bragg's Amino Acids as dressing on spinach. It tastes just like soy sauce. So yeah, it's not the greatest thing ever put on a salad.
Wheeeeeeeeee!
bikes bikes bikes bikes bikes. also, bikes. (me talking to @ashedryden)
@jeffmke We're gonna bike through Estabrook in a bit. Although I assume you're busy with trivia.
Fastest thing on the oak leaf on commute home. I'm not as fast yet as @littletinyfish or @svdodge in a sprint, but beat lots of roadies :D
@ashedryden What am I, chopped faux-liver? Or did I turn invisible? Yarr.
Oh hey paper wasp... Awesome hive... Right on our deck...
Learning MooTools. Because that's what's used on this product.
@ashedryden Also, installed Firediff right now to spit out changes made to CSS in Firebug so that I can actually change the file.

Fairly convinced that this netbook just is incapable of reading from USB. Which is a problem, lacking a CD drive, and all.
I wonder if I can just dd if= of= an image of an installed Windows XP disk onto this netbook. dd is magic!
I have not successfully booted any hardware off MSDN Windows XP images. Lame.
For those in Racine/Kenosha, just found out about a new bike ride starting April 3: Saturdays 8AM, starts outside Common Grounds in Kenosha.
the linux pc won by a long shot. apparently the macbook needs a superdrive to compete.
fixing this  by racing the macbook's combo drive versus the linux pc's DVDRW to burn a WinXP disc to copy to USB.
I don't have a life. I just play one on TV.
I think I just pulled my jaw muscles. Like a pulled muscle in your leg.. only in my face. Ugh.
The free @digg app is here for iPhone! To celebrate they're giving out a custom #ipad each day for 2 weeks! 
We just hit page 1000 in the textbook. Woohoo, 1000 pages of math done.
Crashing without coffee.
Phrases i invent while talking to @ashedryden, exhibit A: "get these brickabraka chimps off my brickabraka plane."
@jeffmke Yeah, I didn't have fluids and I was riding into the wind for most of my commute. It was rough. Plus, allergies (see prev tweet)
Weather.com was right. There *is* a lot of pollen & dust out there today. Especially when i was cycling thru construction. My throat is raw.
Doing service on my bike's (only) brake before I leave Bucketworks. Because stopping is important.
@whil I may catch some flak for saying that we're not those things on the site, but I think it appeals to new folks.
New favorite Indian food: 
@whil On Monday, yes. And we have a site now for updates: 
@whil We'd love to have you on the MIM Ride!
In Cudahy now. Back on the Oak Leaf.
Way out in St. Francis.
Pit stop complete. Back on the road!
Awesome weather out. Rode for an hour; planning on a few more hours on the bike. Rehydrating & eating an apple first.
Truing @ashedryden's new wheels.
Decided to run to alterra instead of wait for 45 minutes at the bike collective. Mmm coffee.
At the bike collective.. A little early. Heh. Standing in the rain.
Mapping, planning, packing. Off to the MKE Bike Collective with a stop at Roast to get coffee, in a few minutes.
@plusrich whaaaaa?
Coding.
Reminder: tomorrow night is the Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride! 6PM outside Cafe Hollander on Downer. 
Hey, we got XP for that encounter with the shopkeeper, right?
In other news, @ashedryden's cats love the kale chips she just made.
Burnt out.
@whil which has been, in practice, too late to change evening plans.
@whil My problem with the UWM Planetarium mailing list: they update you on whether they're going to be open at around 5PM the day of.
Debating whether I should go to Roast to redeem my free coffee punchcard. Interested in meeting up, @svdodge?
@schmenzer This Easter Egg bubble is going to last forever! We'll make millions! The market can never crash! See also: Snow Futures theory.
@talktostrangers Will have to take your thoughts on the new series into consideration. Most reviews aren't liking Matt Smith.
@talktostrangers New UK season with Matt Smith as the Doctor, or what's currently playing on Scifi Channel? (Syfy now?)
@nikulr I think I'll wait for a cheaper one. With 3G. Heh.
@nikulr So, did you get an iPad?
@whil and that took 2.5 hours with several long pit stops (alterra, yay)
@whil Rough estimate is 30+ miles. Fell asleep before I finished mapping last night, because I rode around aimlessly & that complicated it.
Mapping my bike route today in Google Earth to see how far I rode.
@jeffmke thanks :D see you Monday?
Web dev folks: Which version of reset.css should I use? Reasons? Thanks.
My GMail timestamps are all off by an hour. Can't find where the timezone setting is. feeling stupid.
Replying to some customer service emails quick during my pit stop in Shorewood :-)
After a 15 minute pit stop at the foundry alterra, i'm getting back on the road. Thinking about riding up to Bayshore.
Showed up at Cafe Hollander early for once. An hour early. Don't let the threat of rain keep you from coming. Hope to see lots of folks at 6
Thing I should be doing as a cyclist: memorizing where all the public accessible bubblers & Bathrooms are in MKE.
Also, before you try it, Gitosysadmin is not ready for prime time. I've yet to merge in my actual repo-manipulating code from test scripts
A few changes to Gitosysadmin that I thought up during ride into work:  Doing more things "the Sinatra Way" now.
@plural my vote is to go with wildflowers and prairie grasses ;-)
Apparently I rally race Porsches now: 
Ugh. Maybe nomming stale old cookies from the Bucketworks kitchen wasn't the best idea.
RT @ashedryden: Don't forget that this Thursday is @web414 - 7pm at @bucketworks! We'll be talking about SXSWi and FunnyOrDie.com. http: ...
Reminder: Mondays-in-Milwaukee Ride, a social bike ride, is tonight. Starts 6PM outside Cafe Hollander 
I finally went to Roast to redeem that free coffee. Beautiful outside right now.
Rough start to the day. Tea, generic cheerios, and then biking to Bucketworks.
This pizza is so good :D (see @ashedryden's twitpic)
Paper Heart should be called "Two of the most awkward people in the whole world are introduced to each other and fall in love."
So that was a short #MIMRide with no folks. Oh well. Hoping for better weather next week!
Still waiting for people at Hollander. #MIMRide
OH: "I got 99 projects, but the b*tches ain't done." Not me. But I share in the sentiment. Too many projects. I think I just started 3 more.
@gilesgoatboy In reply to your Pro Bono Rails blog post: I'll do it for a copy of your video.
@abraham I'll take it. Love @twilio. Need to use it for a project, I think.
Wow, I feel stupid. I just emailed the wrong customer with the wrong instructions. Our support system doesn't have "undo email" like gmail.
Oh sure, the company that spams you with their catalog has a "Request Our catalog" form on their site, but not a "stop sending stuff" form.
@ketchup Your blog is called Ketchup Soup, but it is on Tumblr. If it were on Soup, you could've been 
Forgot that stone creek gives you a free latte with every pound of coffee. Or in my case, a soy redeye.
Quick bike ride to get a pound of coffee, then back to work. Yay.
Need coffee.
@whil @cheshster As long as my continuous tweeting doesn't wake her up when it SMSes her.. oh wait.
@matthusby Because, you know I want to spam everyone to make them feel slow and out of shape every day, on all my social networks.
@matthusby They don't have an RSS feed on my "fitness blog" or a way to automatically post to Facebook/Twitter though. Definitely need those
So despite a nonstick muffin pan AND a thin brushing of canola oil, these muffins stuck to the pan. Gah.
@matthusby @jsadowski Wow, runthere's route mapper is so much smarter than Google Earth. It fits the curves of the Oak Leaf automagically.
Making blueberry muffins for @ashedryden as a surprise. Hope they turn out good. Should have enough to bring some in to work later.
Entertaining @tafferinspace so that @ashedryden can sleep in peace. Home while we wait for internets to be restored at work.
@jeffmke The pizza you make yourself with Wisconsin meats and cheeses, of course.
There's ROT13, which is a 13 place rotation cypher, then there's ROTJ, which is a way to spin Jedi.
Singing "I got some skype spam, skype spam, skype spam."
Watching my favorite Indiana Jones movie with my favorite, @ashedryden. Guess which one it is, and you win a prize!
Coding on Gitosysadmin.
@mrsajbombers I'm not a big fan of SmartBacon. Not sure of good alternatives though. The hard part of being veggie is only having 1 option.
@mrsajbombers craving a veggie version of the barrie burger: smartbacon, teese, pb, vegburger. Let me know if you ever do this as a special?
On our way to @ajbombers with @ashedryden @hrrigbri + @hrrigbri's fiance. Yay @ajbombers ftw.
I'd alert my coworkers that I made another pot of coffee, but we're all telecommuting today so that doesn't really make any sense.
Feel all over the place today.
Another day at home while the internet is getting fixed @bucketworks. Perfect day for coding, laundry & cleaning the road grime off my bike.
@whil Are you sure runing and cycling at this point is a good idea? It seems like you're exercising injured, which can't be good.
@riverwest maybe break it out into separate twitter accounts for each?
Another tool complete. Whee.
trying to decide if I should head down to @web414 tonight or not. is internet back @bucketworks?
I just realized I've biked every day in April so far. Going to ride up to Shorewood later just to get in a short ride for today.
No A9-based iPhone / iPod Touch? I'm as disappointed as I can be.
Snowing in Riverwest.. Or is this tiny hail?
RT @joshjs: Apple totally stole these "multitasking" and "folders" features from Microsoft.
@ashedryden I was at a funeral, they planned to put ashes in Lake Michigan (which is illegal) but the wind blew it back into their faces.
waiit. what, apple keynote? no one told me this was gonna happen..
Scary how code written 2 days ago looks completely incomprehensible. Then again, it is in a different text editor. Color scheme is all wrong
It looks and feels like fall outside again :-(
Plants vs zombies on the ipad is reason enough to get an ipad.
According to @blissdev, I drink man-chai.
Or just generally places with wifi in/around West Allis, Greendale, Greenfield, Hales Corners?
What good coffee shops are there with wifi & comfy chairs west of MKE, south of 94 west? (Basically, between MKE and Hales Corners)
@svdodge If you flash an ID you can ask a UPS driver for your package. I've done it before. Saves them time.
Baconated envelopes: 
@joshjs You lucky sonova.
It's not easy being spleen.
Me: "Jeff Goldblum was just crazy in Hunch, not like the horse whisperer." @ashedryden: "I don't think the horse whisperer sees dead people"
OH: "Wh are tweets about me?"
Now I feel like a terrible person.
Going to Ben's Cycle with @blissdev.
@eighthinch where are you in the bike expo?
Teaching @blissdev to ride fixie.
Drank my first pot of coffee. Biking to the bike collective in a bit.
Whiners complaining about the lack of Flash on the iphone&ipad have obviously never had to use a PowerPC Mac; never had good flash support.
Ate at Nessun Dorma for the first time.
@ashedryden is letting the cat out of the bag at the apple store.
@nikulr at your apple store for the second time today. And of course you're not here. Heh.
Think i might be talking @blissdev into an @eighthinch bike.
@Bucketworks yAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAy!
@SwigMilwaukee Are you going to be carrying a laptop and textbooks too? Then it'll be fair. Heh.
Brand new touchpad on the Macbook, courtesy of the Apple store. Going from a worn-smooth touchpad to textured touchpad feels so weird.
@jonnyfixedgear Yeah. He was down in the drops pumping to keep up. I hopped back on the Oak Leaf and cruised upright.
Also: hitting the dirt next to the trail at 25mph+ still feels sketchy. I'm now saving up for a set of the Fyxation dual compound tires.
Best way to beat a roadie on a Madone who has that serious "training" face: sprinting past in the dirt next to the trail & ringing my bell.
Time to go get my bike dirty again.
@raster @svdodge ninja camera strap 
@smashd I get the trihawk with mine. Plus my longer hair on the sides + in the back gets feathered.
I guess everyone's busy with the game. Also, #youJustLostTheGame. You're welcome.
MIM Ride update: We're going to start meeting @AJBombers between 5 & 6 to let people eat. Spread the word! Site w/ map: 
@AJBombers We'll try it this week with your guys and they can try to keep up with us? :-)
Bike got cleaned. Now I'm having some rice, white beans, and pasta sauce. Can you say leftovers+random canned food? I can.
@blissdev In an HTML parser, I know exactly what div to pull out as each post. In Y!Pipes, I'm filtering with sed regexes :{
@blissdev almost seemed like parsing it myself was easier than getting the Y! Pipes rules *just right*
@blissdev Kinda needs an RSS exporter. I started one in Y!Pipes but it isn't done. I suppose you could scrape, parse and serve on Sinatra.
@blissdev the top cyclist (by number of miles logged) on @runthere only has 692 miles. I'm gunning for the top position by the end of summer
@blissdev Yep. It's the site with the smart route drawing on GMaps that I showed you. I just estimate my time, and it knows the miles.
Check out Matt Gauger's Fitness Blog -- RunThere  via @runthere
On another note, just rode back from Bucketworks. Beautiful day out. Lots of people biking on the Oak Leaf, which I'm always happy to see.
@AJBombers Awesome. Maybe we can merge our group into the AJ Bombers Riding Group.
@AJBombers Didn't know you guys already had a ride. Cool!
@whil @AJBombers is more centrally located and better food options. I don't think we've ever bothered to eat at Cafe Hollander before/after.
Also throw @jeffmke @mkedave @smashd @mkeluke @schmenzer into that last tweet. Would like your input too. Too little space in a tweet :-)
@AJBombers We're thinking Mon or Tues @ 5. Give people an hr to eat, ride @ 6, back for drinks @ 8 or 9. @littletinyfish @svdodge thoughts?
@AJBombers The MIM Ride  is looking for a new home. Would it be OK to meet @AJBombers & come back after for a drink? ;-)
Trying out the various git & version control API modules for Drupal. Planning a git repo mgmnt install profile; like a dept-level SVN server
@blissdev Excited for your bike build as well.
Going for a bike ride.
@StoneCreekCoffe is the Factory on 5th open to the public? The website doesn't really say.
@jennaddenda I have a free pound of beans at Stone Creek. Just gotta figure out where one is on my route to stop and get some on the way in.
@joshjs I could really use some coffee right now. Is there coffee @Bucketworks?
Making lunch, then biking to Bucketworks. @AJBombers Riding Group ride (merging in the MIM Ride) later tonight. Excited!
Reminder: MIM Ride now starts meeting @AJBombers between 5 & 6 to let people eat. Spread the word! Site w/ map: 
Too many good OH's from class today that I couldn't discreetly tweet. oh well.
@jeffmke congrats!
@jeffmke man, 2 broken spokes. what'd you hit and on what bike?
@svdodge Same here, I think. I'm not too fast off the line with my gearing, either. I'll hold out for a geared cyclocross bike, maybe.
Getting the lights on my bike takes twice as long as the actual bike ride
Gah. Forgot to throw a plastic bag over my suede saddle. Soggy ride home.
Gonna wait until quarter after 6 at @ajbombers for #MIMRide stragglers. Looks like the rain scared everyone off.
Reminder guys: MIM Ride has moved to @ajbombers. hope to see you all here by 6! don't let the rain scare you off :P
At @ajbombers for the group ride. I think i'm gonna grab some dinner, if anyone wants to join me.
Leaving for @ajbombers from walkers point in a few minutes.
@StoneCreekCoffe Thanks. Went to Grand Ave.
@whil Well there's your problem right there. You're writing Fortran.
Coffee beans acquired from @stonecreekcoffe. Omw to @bucketworks.
@jennaddenda Oh. Shops of Grand Ave. Let's hope they've got some tasty coffee beans and a grinder.
Lusting after @gegere's ipad from the back row.
@blissdev I feel bad for my followers. On the other hand, it said nothing of my own intelligence. Wonder how we rank up according to /that/
#todo: get a pico projector.
@matthusby & I are critiquing the PHP code of a wordpress plugin that's up on the projector at the PHP user's group. Shh, don't tell anyone.
@gegere Sitting right behind you, btw. Not that I'm trying to be creepy or anything.
RT @riverwest: MilwaukeeMoms.com sez: Got extra bikes or bike parts? Here's an easy way to recycle them. Inspired by an article on... ht ...
@gegere Haha, that was quite the answer to the intro question ;-)
Today's SCIENCE FACT: @mathiasx fans are dumber than @blissdev fans. 
@MarcLyon I ended my tweet on a cellphone, is the problem. The whole tweet didn't fit on teh screen. Or in one tweet.
High-powered math and I haven't had any coffee yet.
There's detours to the detours on Bus Route 10; part of Holton is closed. Probably will be late for class at this rate. Should've biked.
Need a fendered, pannier-equipped commuter bike to carry my laptop and huge pile of textbooks on.
Time to give @ashedryden a proper viewing of Star Wars: A New Hope.
Now i just have to ride home to Riverwest. Whee.
I need to true my front wheel. I got a little wheelie-happy tonight. When you can pull mad wheelies, every curb looks like a launch ramp.
@ashedryden is teaching her sister @hrrigbri to use her new iPhone, over Skype video chat. They're such nerds.
25.84 miles for the ride total. Didn't ride all the way back to @AJBombers, but good enough for a rainy night.
Time to map out my route for all of today's riding on @RunThere. Just going to lump in commute to/from work with ride & estimate time.
In Shorewood, having a post-ride bowl of frozen fruit as a reward. Gonna stretch out and ride slow back to Riverwest.
I was slow, but I'm at Brown Deer Rd. I do believe Dan @SwigMilwaukee owes me first round next week. Took the MKE River Parkway. Little wet.
Perfect outside right now. #mimride folks are missing out. Heading out on the @ajbombers group ride route from shorewood pit stop
@mkedave That's why I garden on our 2nd story porch in Riverwest ;)
@SwigMilwaukee I can stop by before I head to the MKE @BikeCollective. 5:30 ok?
Inbox 0 on support and voicemail. Win!
@abraham Don't take this the wrong way, but have you gone from Twitter-loving to Twitter-hating?
@jeffmke What's your avg weekly cycling mileage like right now?
@jeffmke nice!
Happiness is a road tire at 120psi.
@mkedave re:effort: I'm not exactly spinning at peak efficiency on 48x15t fixed around MKE. Hrm. Will have to rethink my bike training plans
@smashd @mkedave and the rest of you road racers: Distance/endurance first, then speed? Or the other way around? How do you train?
Just passed 100 miles logged in @RunThere. w00t!
@raster  and 
@raster I ride an @EighthInch bike. Love it. Best bike I've ever had.
When @whil shows up in my GMail, the ads in the sidebar are for FoxPro. Go figure!
For being a test on JS Mill's Utilitarianism, that sure was easy. Maybe the prof wanted to bring good grades to the greatest # of students?
Headwind on the ride to school. Plus traffic and road construction. Still made it here twice as fast as I coulf last fall.
Mornings are a lot easier now that it is sunny before 7AM.
Post- #mkepug dinner at @AJBombers done. beautiful night out. I think I'll go ride my bike.
Also @ashedryden and @gegere are here, but i was lazy in my last tweet.
At @ajbombers for the second night in a row. Came in with @aaronsaray and the #mkepug tonight.
Twitter keeps going down. Lame.
Thanks Dan! @SwigMilwaukee. Headed to MKE @BikeCollective now.
@svdodge I've gotta stop at @SwigMilwaukee first. Will be at the MKE @BikeCollective right around 6PM.
I'll take rush hour on the Oak Leaf over rush hour on the Marquette Interchange any day. Ugh. Gridlock.
@mtbvegan which timbuk2 backpack btw? I know @blissdev was interested in the Hal backpack.
@aaronsaray @blissdev I can say that I'm very happy with their award for the coming school year.
Thank you, @BarackObama. Holy shit. #FAFSA
@mtbvegan I'm carrying, I think, over 35 pounds in my bag on a day with classes and work and a trip to the Bike Collective afterward.
Problem w/ backpacks & messenger bags on my shoulder: the strap sits on soft connective tissue; I don't have the hard tissue there anymore.
Beautiful day that I should be out riding to class. but waiting for the bus instead. textbooks are too heavy to bike with (for my shoulder)
Free coffee at Starbucks today if you bring in a travel mug, apparently. I'm going to give it a shot. 
@riverwest It was a large, bright meteor. Went down in Platteville.
I'm in a weird mood, and I think I'm annoying @ashedryden. If I didn't have a class at 8:30AM, I might go ride my bike some more.
@svdodge awesome.
22.5 miles cycling today. #fitMKE
Dear IRS: I went to print off a tax form, & the page labeled "intentionally left blank" printed 1st, using up all my black ink. Seriously?!
@svdodge crazy. we didn't see anything nearly like this when we went out for the meteor shower last fall. once-in-a-lifetime event.
@scmarhsall45 @lakeicychill @YourMKEDining @svdodge multiple people confirm - it was a huge meteor according to the news.
Just saw a bright orange flare over Riverwest / Harambee. It went in a weird arc, @svdodge thinks it looked like a plane on fire. @Riverwest
This is the game where we all tell each other to decide what to make for dinner. #indecisive. #mathiasxIsFrustrated. #hashtagsAreFunThough.
#yakawow 
Free pound of alterra coffee to start my morning off.
Job security is randomly picking indentation levels among functions, if statements, and foreaches, all nested.
The script I've been passed to hack on also has a bunch of "isTrue()" functions that are then tested like this: if (!isTrue() do this. Ugh.
Oh gah it's one of those guys that never learned how to properly write an if statement or indent. Or use curly braces. Lovely.
I think this is the first time I've used a Twitter DM to send PHP code to someone. It is surprising it took this long, actually.
Thought I'd need another ride on the bike today, but now dinner has set in and I'm sleepy. Good night, folks.
Man, I'm full now. #hugeDinner #vegan #fitMKE #bikeMKE.
"An updated version of Google Reader is available. Click here to refresh." ooOooo
@whil Man, AC/DC, that's some classical music right there. Not the baroque stuff like Ice Ice Baby, either.
7.44miles with @chrisgauger on the Oak Leaf. Met up with @ashedryden and @Lyndzi.
OH: "What do these people do that they can ride bikes all the time and not have a job?" -- @ashedryden
@svdodge At least you can say you conquered that wind. People in cars? Not so much. They don't even realize when there's a headwind.
@ashedryden just took off on her new road bike on a test ride. I think she likes it so much she's riding it home from 29th & Clybourn
Saturday morning Lady Gaga rock out.
Poured a travel mug of coffee before i left home. It tasted terrible & I had to dump it out. need to wash mug thoroughly. also need: coffee.
It's going to be a long day. Woke up at 6 because of the sun. Maybe I'll get in a bike ride before the Milwaukee River Cleanup.
OH: "OOooh we gotta watch return of the Ewoks... I mean err.."
Man, freewheel hub tools. We don't haz them.
Note to self: read the instructions on the chain lube carefully. It says "wipe off excess" for a reason. A very messy road grime + chain ...
Happy @tafferInSpace now that I'm here to take care of him for a bit.
Beautiful morning for a bike ride.
Looks like next weekend might include a day trip to Chicago, and definitely includes a 50+ mile ride.
@svdodge I had my winter bike (geared mountain bike with slicks) on the way back from Riverwest tonight. Was trying the high cadence stuff.
@svdodge Cold outside, and comfortable inside here as well. Maybe you, @lukestory, @chrisgauger and me can go for a long ride tomorrow?
@JoeSteve Aha. I was going off of what the Facebook tips said (bring a big bag)
I think @ashedryden just gave me the go-ahead to build her a Sturmey-Archer 3-speed hub into a wheel for her new bike :-)
@JoeSteve Yeah, definitely. It was just a busy weekend and I still don't have a big bag.
@JoeSteve nice!
The fact that @ashedryden's new bike's derailleurs are borked really makes me want to build it into a singlespeed for her.
@chrisgauger and I did about 6 miles on the Oak Leaf just now. @ashedryden's new bike has issues with the gears, so she couldn't come.
Reminder: Monday night is the @AJBombers Riding Group ride! (formerly MIM Ride) Info: 
Trying to adjust a sidepull brake perfectly without the right tools is frustrating.
Yeah totally. May go get some groceries on it as a test ride. Tuning up the sidepulls for max braking power.
Home made garlic mashed potatoes. Yum! I love the Rapunzel brand vegetable bouillon.
@littletinyfish I'm not buying bikes, just pointing out nice ones.
@jeffmke ok. have a good night :-)
@jeffmke Wanna ride with us tonight @AJBombers? Or come join us afterwards to have drinks?
Gearing up for the @AJBombers Riding Group ride and heading out. See you all at @AJBombers!
@smashd see you @AJBombers later then! I've been looking forward to seeing that Colnago in person.
@AJBombers @Jungbow Lucida Grand
It smells like terrible, terrible incense here. Neighbors are trying to mask their drug habit again.
This is a really beautiful bike:  Someone nice go buy it and ride it!
I don't think this pharmacy is filling prescriptions today. Been here forever waiting. Frustrated :/
Trying to find a metric ruler. And I misplaced my Leatherman knockoff, which has a tiny ruler etched into it.
@blissdev If you want to get technical, southeastern Wisconsin :-)
I love Milwaukee. And I love my Milwaukee friends. Just so you all know.
@plural Definitely. I'll update the site. I've been too busy with school+work lately to plan anything. Talk to @Knellotron? @MKEHackerHouse.
Reminder: @AJBombers Group Ride tonight. meet 5-6PM at @AJBombers on Water Str to meet, greet, and eat. 6PM we ride. Drinks after. #FitMKE.
@TheBird Have you heard about @TheWord? Oh well-a bird bird bird, bird is the word..
Coding on my open source project ( before I have class. Earlier than I usually think about code.
@smashd It'd be great to roll up at a race on an Xtracycle holding my bike, my tools and everything else, heh.
@smashd Saw a trailer that used halved PVC pipe in the same manner. That said, if we're hauling bikes for the Collective, we can pile them.
OH: "All I ever wanted in life was to be a cheerleader" -- @chrisgauger.
"I laugh in the face of danger, then I hide until it goes away." -- Zander on Buffy.
@svdodge Hmm. May want that one for @ashedryden's bike.
@svdodge coaster brake 3 speed hub? Oh wait, we sold that one.
@svdodge Drum brakes?
@svdodge this is the point where we claim that we're hauling cargo on a bike trailer because the gearing on our SS/fixie bikes is too easy.
@svdodge most of the trailers on instructables.com are too small. what do you have in mind?
@svdodge also, another good reason to build my idea, the bike-hauling bike trailer.
@svdodge ok. Let me check with her. We may have to sell her washer/dryer first for space :-)
OH: "Baconated pizza?" -- @chrisgauger
@chrisgauger and I are going to watch all of Buffy. Starting with the first episode while we eat pizza.
@TeecycleTim Are you the Tim from Shorewood looking to donate 6 bikes to the @BikeCollective? Twitter would make organizing much easier ;)
Making pizza with @chrisgauger.
All my coffee travel mugs taste horrible, even with thorough washing. Time for a new travel mug, or is there a secret cleaning technique?
Problems: weather.com doesn't use browser location capability to know where I am. Or even roughly GeoIP it. They still have pop-ups, though!
A sail! A sail! I don't even know why I still own this stupid shirt.
I think America is the only place where a size Medium dress shirt fits like an XL on a guy who's 6' & exercises, yet the shoulders are tight
Trying to figure out how I get Planet Bikes to cover my Blaze LED headlight under warranty. It just stopped working this past weekend :/
@AJBombers Thanks for being our host. Last night was awesome :-)
@plural "I'll write a virus on the mobile and spread it across the internet. I bet you're wondering why I'm writing a virus on a mobile?"
@JoeSteve well, @blissdev is planning to try to come down from Hales Corner a few times this summer on his new bike. Maybe you can carpool.
Also, pretzels and salsa to go with that the Blue Sky cola. Wow, I'm hungrier than I thought I'd be.
@JoeSteve Thanks for coming down all the way from Stallis.
Enjoying a post-ride Blue Sky Cola (no HFCS) and its sugary goodness. It was earned. EARNED.
My @RunThere route is shows I rode 25.4 miles on the @AJBombers Group Ride tonight, including the extra ride down to Bay View. Awesome!
Neil's post on Tumblr about the @AJBombers Group Ride tonight: 
@svdodge,  & I followed up @AJBombers Group Ride w/ a ride down to Bay View to grab Neil's stuff from the gym.
I'd say the @AJBombers Group Ride went great! Great turn-out. Great people. Thanks to everyone that came out!
@littletinyfish I'd love to live along the Oak Leaf and have my own little on-ramp.
I just want to be out riding my bike right now.
I have a headache again.
@svdodge @chrisgauger has the Onitsuka Tigers & likes them. They fit well in his toe clips, but he said there was a bit of pedal push.
@Tmtx not a good idea for my rough and tumble bike lifestyle then :P
@Tmtx @giania what about glass? like a thermos?
@Giania @Tmtx My travel mugs are all plastic. I think I need to upgrade to one with a screw-on lid that won't leak in my bike bag anyways.
@svdodge That's why we should build a trailer.
Thank you, @PlanetBike. You guys are awesome :-)
"Ah, the Dutch--New York's original gentrifiers." - @bikesnobnyc
Headache is gone care of The National Bakery's Metropolis coffee. But now I just got something in my eye. Gah, it burns. Halp.
The three ambulances that have gone by have cemented this headache into my skull. Gah.
Tornado drill. Break time!
Going down to the @BikeCollective tonight to help @blissdev finish building his new bike.
@ashedryden It's a Windows server, I'm sure you could "own" it easily enough. Problem solved.
@ashedryden Solution: Install Linux.
Dresses are serious business.
@wikkidinnocence Not upset that I got beat by a girl; just surprised. I've been locking up next to her bike for months but never met her.
Instituted measures to apply peanut butter to both sides of a pb&banana. I think this is a prudent move in the face of an uncertain future.
Dude on a Bianchi just beat me in a race from RW to MATC. Got here and realized: that's a chick! And she's hot!
Good morning, @ashedryden. I love you.
@smutandeggs The "I found my new winter bike!" tweet is an ongoing joke for me :-) I'll have to include you next time.
@littletinyfish @svdodge I found my new winter bike: 
Playing with:  My version pulling more info from the Yahoo!Weather API: 
OH: "It should just work like Chrome does.. when Google Chrome is working.."
OH: "So you can have any other options or whatever the hell.." "Whatever the hell?" "That's my third favorite option."
At @ashedryden's #DrupalSchool. Trying not to be the smart alec in the class.
Woke up cold and hungry. Apparently I fell asleep on the office couch for 2 hours, and now no one is here. Oops.
I think the company macbook's hdd is dead. Not good. Will try to recover it.
Deaf.
Right when we catch up in class, a Tsunami ruins it.
Still get cell reception in the basement. Hiding from the tsunami.
MATC is under a Tsunami warning (tornado drill)
"I can draw pretty pictures with a holograaaam."
@jeffmke nice!
So that's frustrating. I guess I'll just pound on this homework until it gets done. Or the sun comes up. Whichever is first.
Missed a turn off of Beloit and ended up in New Berlin. Backtracking sucks. Also: got fries and a milkshake thrown at me. They missed.
Halfway to Hales Corners on my bike. Forest Home wasn't necessarily the best route to take.
Booted the macbook off a Snow Leopard USB key, loaded utilities off SL install DVD. Macbook is still hosed. Lame.
Goal: make every day part of Bike to Work Week.
@Narkalant Is that robot on your blog packing heat, or are those just some black pipes?

@DrNautilus Your last tweet hinted at a preference for steam over diesel in your locomotive. Alas, my joke is lost to the aether.
@DrNautilus You're such a steampunk.
@mariehuynh I've only ever seen it used incorrectly/ambiguously on

Bike distance for the day: 41 miles.
For those that are wondering what @blissdev is riding: this  turned into this: 
Blair witch project. On bikes. On the Oak Leaf.
Rode to 124th & North Ave from Hales Corners with @blissdev. Quick pit stop & then we're headed home.
@corbenfrost maybe someday. @ashedryden is supposed to design a real one for me.

I got a tattoo. Pics in a bit.
Standing at the bus shelter and it seems the pothole on Humbolt is perfectly positioned to splash into the bus shelter. Lame.
A month ago I got rid of my old Trek MTB that I wasn't using. Today we got rid of the rest of the spares: my winter bike & the trainer bike.
Dropped 12" Powerbook this morning and bent up the area where the power plug goes. Gah, I'm unintentionally destroying every machine I have.
@svdodge I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain..
@mkedave Where are you racing today?
Still a little worn out from all that biking yesterday. Decided to play it safe and not bike anywhere today so that I can recover a little.
Thinking about heading out onto the wet streets to attempt bike skids and ride around a quiet (traffic-less) Riverwest and East Side.
Reminder: @AJBombers Group Ride Monday @AJBombers on Water Str. 5PM to meet & eat dinner. 6PM we ride. Drinks after. 
Eating granola from Outpost with chocolate-covered espresso beans in it. finishing homework now seems possible.
@jeffmke congrats!
@littletinyfish Or if you want to go for a ride, I can just check it out then. Heh.
@littletinyfish Still no pictures of the new bike?
@jeffmke awesome! keep up the good work :-)
@blissdev I hope your MBP is OK. That really sucks.
@avanhizzle Quinoa adds a slightly nutty flavor & has the texture of couscous. If that's your thing, it really goes well in anything w/ rice
Sunday morning earworm. Love this song. ♫ 
@avanhizzle Protip: Riverwest Coop has it cheaper in bulk than Whole Foods or Outpost.
@ashedryden that is true. Good fats in avocados.
I forgot to mention salsa in my tweet about lunch. Tasty salsa is very important to this dish.
@avanhizzle Yep. For almost 3 years now.
It is depressing to realize that more of your time is probably spent looking at stupid stuff online than with friends and family.
3 plates of pinto beans, brown rice & quinoa. Need to get protein/caloric intake proportional to the cycling I'm doing. Favorite easy meal.
Feeling a lot less worn out today. @MKEHackerHouse was a blast. Thanks for putting it on @plural!
I've only succeeded in making this project worse tonight. Just not in the zone. Relaxing with people and talking about code is awesome, tho.
@ashedryden That would be the sausage, chicken, and ribs in the kitchen. @MKEHackerHouse. #weAreVegetariansSoWeAreGoodThx.
OH: "Salsa-drunk."
can't stop eating chips and salsa at @MKEHackerHouse.

Just made it to @AJBombers. sorry to anyone that showed up for the ride & didn't find me. traffic was rough.
On my way to @AJBombers. We got caught in traffic, so I'm running a bit late.
Hoping to see lots of folks at the @AHJBombers group ride i should be there right around 6, maybe later. Beautiful weather for a ride.
Couldn't remember what software to install on freshly-revived Macbook. Went back to my WI Setup interview for a list: 
@bucketworks anyone have a snow leopard dvd with them? I left mine at home and we're trying to fix the macbook.
Post office on Capitol in Shorewood has no bike racks. Locked to a bump barrier  at the gas station next door. Lame.

@ashedryden has a new theme song.
@hypnagogic is getting a beautiful Bianchi road bike tonight, it looks like.
@blissdev How's the bike?
Stopping in walker's point for a second so @svdodge can take his sunglasses off. Water str is a mess. After downtown i think i'm headed  ...
Patrick Cudahy was a fixed gear trickster. See @svdodge's twitpic for proof.
Stopping in Cudahy Park. Trying to find a bubbler. Bugs everywhere. 14ish miles so far.
They see me rollin', they hatin' 
I manually unsubscribe myself from marketing 1-2 times a day. When will I not be left on any lists?
@svdodge I wish I was out riding, too.
OH: "Oh yeah. A lot of animals died."
@hypnagogic tweaked the quick release on your bike to close tighter & straightened wheel in chainstays. Let me know if you have more issues.
@TeecycleTim congrats! :-)
I like @DailyMile's design  this leaderboard is a good motivator, too. especially if I had more friends. hint hint.
Advanced novices are dangerous. Especially when they start trying to teach others. They don't have the experiene to see the big picture.
This battlestation (read: Macbook) is now fully operational. It is now the ultimate power in thre galaxy (my apartment)
All done. woot.
Up way too late for early math classes. Need to crash soon.
@nikulr probably not. taking the bus tomorrow.
@nikulr then again I keep trying to do these without fnInt()
@nikulr there's definitely some tricky stuff. not a fan of random integrals we need to just know that are a small step in the problem.
@nikulr Finishing up.
@nikulr haha. I'm probably studying for the same thing. test tomorrow, woo!
@svdodge I may keep routes in @friendfit, since I already have a bunch there & just put raw mileage in @dailymile. Seems like it might work.
Wondering if duplicating the same tracking on both @friendfit and @dailymile is worth it. Certainly want to be friends with users on both.
256 miles for April on the bike. SO FAR.

@JoeSteve Dude. We need to start a "West" version of the Mondays ride. Beautiful riding on the Oak Leaf & in Greenfield Park out there.
@smutandeggs We rode right by the Palomino, sorry we didn't know to stop. Had to get home to catch up on homework though.
Made a pretty bland dinner, but lots of it. Brown rice, steamed green peppers and mushrooms, and carmelized onions. Garlic mixed in.
I have been making dinner so intently for the past 40 minutes that I forgot to tweet!

Rain, rain, go away. Come again another day..
@littletinyfish @jeffmke  Man, today *had* to be the day I stop packing my rain coat, didn't it?
@gregtarnoff None close by here.
Oh right. New laptop means no tools installed.
Where are there vegan burritos in Milwaukee besides the East Side? (No Fuel, RW Coop, etc.) Walkers Point or Third Ward would be perfect.
@EighthInch Hoping to put a lot more miles on  it this summer ;)
Some days I can't put a sentence together. Today is one of those days.
@EighthInch Random question, do you ever get contacted about how many miles people are putting on their frames? I tracked 300+ mi for April.
303 miles on my bike for April. Awesome! Feeling really good :-)
@cogmag_kevin I'm running kind of low, too, and forgot to top it off before I left my apartment earlier.
In lieu of a faster lunch, i had a can of organic black beans with salsa. Protein!
You know you're a bike nerd when you use your Camelbak to water the houseplants on your way out the door.
Watched video of a guy building a SFF PC w/16Tb of HDDs. It was slick, cool music, until he started arc welding the case w/ HDDs in it. No!
@np7776 @smutandeggs *is* awesome with an awesome twitter name. It's true.
@EighthInch I am definitely interested in that. You guys make great stuff, btw.
Having a serious allergy attack ever since the commute home. Must be something in the air out there.
Looks like we're gonna stop at Noodles&co. Sad that @smutandeggs won't be our server.
297 miles for April. So far.
Time to catch up on Doctor Who.
Aside from all the bugs, nice weather for cycling. The wind has really calmed down just inland from the lake.
Had a really fast ride home from BW. Gotta figure out my avg speed. riding to laundromat with @ashedryden quick.

Chuck Palahniuk is to masculinity as Oprah is to spirituality: pseudo-religious and lacking in actual meaning.

I think I'm gonna puke. Fake ham was not a good idea.
I don't think dainty tea room finger foods is going to power me 20+ miles today. Sorry @ashedryden. I'm gonna make burritos.
Ordered vegan "ham" and white bean soup. Kind of scared. Never liked ham.
My wasteful, null-income lifestyle isn't working out. All the little cracks are showing themselves. & frustrating other people in my life :/

@littletinyfish We had a discussion as to whether a backpack or panniers are safer for a laptop while commuting. Which spawned the question.

It's so nice to commute in leisurely on a sunny morning and say "good morning" to every person i pass.
I just can't win.
OH: Look at how cute I would be bald!
The nerve in my collarbone is still irritated and still making my arm fall asleep. My messenger bag just makes it worse. I can't win.
Week in review:  I've logged 85 miles for the last week, but DailyMile is only showing me 42. Weird.
Coincidence. Sorry @cogmag_kevin, @3liza is on the west coast. 
Had a great night at the Palomino with @smutandeggs and her friends. Nice cool ride home. Spotted a fox on the Oak Leaf. Gardening now.
I'm now very convinced of why one shouldn't run cheap tires. Cheap tires have cheap sidewalls.
I was just reading about this danger on Sheldon's site yesterday: "Braking a wheel that has a deflated tire ... is likely to cause a crash."
Didn't have a patch kit or a spare tire (using my laptop bag today) and so I had to push it home. Lamesauce.
I flatted going downhill on rough pavement (tire pinch, tore sidewall up). Grabbing for the brake put me over the bars. Shoulder is fine.
Ripped open my gfront tire. Flatted. Went over the bars. I'm ok.
@mtbvegan Is it the big enameled Thermos or the travel mug with the flip top?
@whil Professor Geil at MATC. But it isn't SF forcefields, it is fields of forces like a map of wind speed/direction, or current of a river.
@RideMCTS Please tell drivers that they can't ride in the bike lane to avoid merging. & honking at a cyclist to move over is uncalled for.
Math class is now in force fields and the river differential equations from Cryptonomicon. really.
It's been a weird week so far. And it is only Tuesday.
High-powered math: "sketch the phase portraits from the nullclines and/or vector fields." i know kung fu.
Only days for review and tests left in my math classes.
I wish I had a thermos big enough for a whole pot of coffee. travel mug is notoriously leaky in my bag on my bike.
@skamphax0r Luckily, I don't think it is broken then :-) Just bruised, probably really irritated the nerve too.
@skamphax0r Yeah, makes sense. I've had my other shoulder destroyed, I know what it feels like when it's /impossible/ to do a certain action
I should add to symptoms: collarbone has also been swollen, sensitive to touch & moving my arm. I've been told I have a high pain tolerance.
Wondering if the annoying 'nerve' in my collarbone has been a broken collarbone for the past few weeks. wouldn't it hurt a lot more? #webMD.
@svdodge I have 347 miles since April, when I started tracking them again.
@whil An @ashedryden doppelganger, on a bike?! You should have txted me.
@svodge Just mapped my route (w/ride from @Bucketworks). I may not have mapped far enough north. Oh well, 19.83 miles sounds good to me.
Going through a half dozen bike blogs, reading tire reviews. Obsessed? A little.
@blissdev hot damn
@raster I actually could use a trailer right now. I saw some wood that I want to upcycle but can't carry. Not that my bike works right now.
@blissdev What'd you get?
The other thing crash taught me was that my laptop backpack won't stay on unless I'm standing upright. Needs a chest strap and/or waist belt
@JoeSteve @littletinyfish @svdodge I'll take durability on my next tire. 
@svdodge I tried to do the singlespeed in jeans last year. And I would've made it, too, if those traintracks hadn't COME OUT OF NOWHERE.
Someone want to recycle my old tires into some belts? I'm serious. I need belts.
@JoeSteve My bike can fit the 28c Fyxations, verified at Bike Expo at the @EighthInch/Fyxation booth. Would rather have the width, tbh.
Apparently Vittoria's are out. Toss-up between Continental Ultra Gatorskins or dropping the cash on a set of Fyxation black/green tires.
@JoeSteve Are you running Vittoria's on any of your bike? Need new tires, wide, grippy, durable are all pluses.
@JoeSteve You're making me miss my old sparkle-orange Schwinn paperboy bike. Heh. I'm sure it went to a good home.
@Tmtx Depending on where you add commas there, that has about 15 different meanings.

@littletinyfish but you're welcome to use it for now.
@littletinyfish Weighing the not-having-a-bike possibility until I can afford something else.
@littletinyfish Honestly, I don't know what going rate is. It's used, so it wouldn't be $wheelset/2.
@JoeSteve Did you fly your bike there, too, or renting one?
Yellow Teese makes for weird nachos. thought I'd finally found a use for this accidentally-purchased yellow Teese.

Want to plan a big ride in the next two weeks. DM if interested.
@blissdev good deal.
Rainy mornings compel me to listen to stories on npr.org while I drink my coffee. Feels right.
@blissdev that sucks. Riding to work on your bike FTW.
@cthielen I blocked him, out of spite. Not that it accomplished much.
@jennaddenda I'm all about promoting more ladies on bikes.
My whole left leg is stiff and sore. Guess which leg probably took the brunt of my crash?
@jennaddenda I know, right? #alsoFollowingNow.
Why am I not hungry?
I think my tire choices are narrowed down to Continental Ultra Gatorskin 700x28c and Schwalbe Marathon 700x28c. Similar price, ~$39 ea
Beautiful weather, nice light, crazy wind, and I don't have a bike to ride. Lame.
@smutandeggs Landlords only ever know 2 months in advance if someone is moving out. They can't show out apartments that still have tenants.
Apparently I pocket-txted Twitter, @matthusby and my mom.

Talking with @ashedryden, @hypnagogic and @jennaddenda has put me in such a good mood & starting turning so many gears in my head. Giddy.
I take offense to the "you don't want to talk to people making bicycles" comment :P
Lovely. Traditional marketer explaining social media in scope of marketing to people. Want to say "It's a conversation not a sales pipeline"
Trying to relax. Not succeeding.
@blissdev Conti Gatorskin Ultras from Ben's Cycle (@MilwaukeeBikeCo) they look awesome. need to mount them tonight and get a short ride in.
New tires. Thanks to @ashedryden, because she's awesome ^_^

Grilled veggie, bean, and rice burritos (vegan, of course.) They were YUM.

Woke up at 4AM. Body thinks it is time to go to school. Couldn't fall back asleep. Time to work, I guess.
OH: "Dinner is a DuraFlame log."
Awesome spontaneous discussion tonight about bicycle culture, Milwaukee's history of segregation, and community tonight. Unexpected.
Time to go mount some tires and burn some rubber.
Oh look I'm posting on "the social media"
@littletinyfish You too? I had quite a few of those.
Had to ride up thru Kletzch Park because the bathrooms there are open.
Rode from the lakefront up oak leaf to estabrook, went west at hampton instead of north for a change. Today is all about endurance training.
Went to go ride the path around Lakeshore State Park, my own little velodrome. Conti gatorskins continue to impress, especially on 2nd str.

@jonnyfixedgear Aha, that's what they were. I couldn't tell if they had freewheels+hidden brakes for when the actors were on them, or what.
Soaks up bumps, relative to my old tires. Humbolt Ave's bump-crack sections every 10 feet aren't so bad anymore.
New tires are impressive. Despite the rain, I couldn't get it to skid. Very solid feeling on the 28c width. Doesn't feel sluggish at all.
Going for a short ride to warm up and test out my new tires.
@JoeSteve Cool! The headtube shock always seemed like a neat idea. How does it ride?

Brake pad grit made my fork turn black/grey. Yes, it was that bad. Also: riding in teh rain sucks.
Only final exams left in all my classes. At the end of the road in math, I think.

@cheshster Sprint needs to tell us when they plan to have 4G elsewhere, but they know about the Osborne effect -- people will wait to buy.
@trodrigues Funny thing is that the netbook I've had my eye on, the ASUS 1201N has acceleration for HD & dual core Atom, so may do it better
@trodrigues Maybe if the video was the only thing running. But we've had time-sharing in OSes for what.. 40 years now? Shouldn't be an issue
@JoeSteve Yeah. Agreed.
It amazes me that a dual core 2.2Ghz processor still can't play HD video without stuttering. What a terribly disappointing future.
@JoeSteve Are you going to be switching to an Android phone like @blissdev? Just curious.

@raster That is, I'm offering to talk a bit, too, about how poorly implementation and adoption is going.

Anyone have experience with running a hackintoshed Dell Mini 9/10 as their main machine? (not just a toy) Or just using a netbook in general
@svdodge that's good news. Tell him congrats for me.
I'm spending the majority of my time today waiting for the commandline to update (beachballing) and my laptop is overheating. Bad headache.
Thought I just heard someone call @kevron "Captain." Thinking from now on, he can be "Kaptain @Kevron" on the @bucketb.

My personal dev server in the server room wasn't booting past BIOS screen. So *that's* why it dropped off the radar and i couldn't ping it.

@ashedryden connected to your shiny monitor with VGA. VGA!
@ashedryden How many apps are running? How many Adobe apps? :P
@Arlen $5 2gig USB flash drives?
@DrNautilus a) there's always more books to read that i don't own. b) digital versions are far more efficient in terms of storage.
another flaw of the dell mini 9's keyboard: no tilde/backtick key. no more shell scripting for me on the go, i guess.
Trying really hard to convince myself to get rid of a lot of books. (Especially the ones I won't read again.) Books will make moving harder.
@Arlen @ashedryden There's VGA-to-DVIa which use analog, but converting analog to digital requires active hardware. HDMI is fully digital.
@trodrigues now i just need a tiny external monitor and i'll be set!
My Dell Mini 9 next to my macmini (media server) makes my computing setup look very tiny.
OH: "Dr. Wizard of Oz shoes?"
@ashedryden but my new hackintosh has VGA only :(
Looks like a beautiful day, perfect to sit on my porch and work remotely.
Moving @chrisgauger's stuff out. Nice cool day for a movew.
using a netbook is definitely one of those "living in the future" moments. Especially when it is more powerful than my last laptop.
Dell mini 9 issues for developers: right shift key is tiny, brackets need function key & apostrophe is down where right CMD key would be.
@Arlen It's a webapp designed to run jQuery 1.2.x & then hacked to run 1.3.6 for jQueryUI. Can't just jump to 1.4.2; things would break more
@Arlen yeah I've gotta go in, replace it all, verify web app is still working where it does work, then continue to track down this bug.
No, don't bother to look up our order. Keep playing with your ipod.
Everything works on this hackintosh dell mini 9. And it's tiny tiny tiny!
The people i bought it from were really nice. @ashedryden and I tried to talk them into coming to @web414 and barcamp milwaukee.

@solobasssteve This was for sale locally, cheaper than Dell Outlet refurb unit, & came w/8-cell battery + OCZ SSD installed. Was worth it ;)
@solobasssteve I love the mini 9, it's so powerful for its size and therefore useful. But as a coder, I need the full-size keyboard ;)
@solobasssteve nice! i had to put the Apple sticker on mine, like yours.
@matthusby Yeah, everything works out of the box, no iDeneb needed or anything. Wifi, function keys, audio, bluetooth, etc.

Gotta love the 10-hour battery life:  (screen brightness at full, wifi and bluetooth being used)
Figured out what music I wanted to carry with me on external HDD by use of a little statistics, Last.FM charts, and a lot of bash scripts.
@KeVroN We can also have a writeable iTunes master library shared off of it.
@KeVroN It has a wifi card, but sticking it wired in the server room on the shelf might make more sense. Or make it also drive the other TV.

@fragmad I've been very impressed by Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook Remix but it doesn't quite replace my OSX-addiction yet.
@fragmad Just off the top of my head, offenders that add icons to Applebar (that I still use) are Last.fm, droplr, Google QuickSearch, &more
@fragmad This is a huge pet peeve of mine. Far too many Mac apps add junk icons in the same reason, and I won't use them because of it.
Scatter-brained while trying to get some stuff done.
@MarcLyon thanks :)
@smutandeggs Amsterdam tends to be a cheap hub to travel elsewhere in Europe, from what I've read.
What is the word for a medical doctor's credentials after their name, such as "MD GS" in "Dr. John Doe MD GS" ?
@raster and that would replace the cooling pad.
@raster If I can find a small side-blowing fan (like PC towers had in PCI slots) then I glue on a USB plug & use right side vent for cooling
The cat grabbed the headphone cable and jumped out of my lap with it, yanking the earbuds out of my ears. Not a pleasant feeling.
@raster well, I'd like to pare it down by getting a bluetooth Apple keyboard and a SDHC card to replace the smaller external HDD.
A long long time ago, I had really short hair: 
@schmenzer nice!
@smutandeggs Have you looked into flights from elsewhere, like Amsterdam? Might be cheaper to hop.
@raster Yes. 
The accessories required to support this netbook are getting a little ridiculous: external hdd, keyboard, bluetooth mouse & cooling pad.

@tapps we need to get fast internet at our new house, but probably just going to get the fancy Roadrunner.
I haven't even been on my bike since around the time the UPAF ride happened, I've been so busy :(
I need to get out and be social. Seriously. Way overworked (still working on something on a Sunday at 6PM.) Ideas? Suggestions?
@tapps u-verse?
I cut my hair for the first time in over a year. Like a true frugal geek, I did it myself, and it looks pretty terrible.
@trodrigues Apple is catering to the grandma-user there. They don't mean to delete-delete files, ever. They just hide them from you.
One of my photos getting some creative commons love:  (warning, this is some spammy bog that I don't endorse)
@whil Maybe these guys?  but I don't have an AARP card yet.
@jeffmke After I move, I may have to join you on such a weekend.
@jeffmke bike bike bike, beer, sleep sleep sleep?
I'd be curious to test how Javascript eats battery runtime on my laptop. Just need some free time and a controlled environment.
@alexfalkenberg This pic isn't much better quality, 
@alexfalkenberg I really do love this little laptop.  Hackintoshed Dell Mini 9 w/SSD.
@gregtarnoff not so awesome when the external HDD isn't recognized anymore.
Yes, Mac OSX, the disk was removed without ejecting it first. That's because it was forcefully removed, by gravity.
@mariehuynh $ drush cc all # 
@alexfalkenberg it doesn't have a fan, I don't have AC, and it is summer.
Set up my command center at work with a few spare laptops.
@mkedave Ouch, dude. I've been there (with the dislocated shoulder) Wishing you speed in your recovery.
We're watching High Fidelity on Hulu, and I have to imagine this is @corbenfrost's book store except Jack Black is in love with Todd Louiso.
Error 503: Dreamhost Temporarily Unavailable.. for the last hour that I've been trying to save this.
I get @ashedryden's iphone 3gs until she sells it.
Waaaaaaiting at the Apple store *boredom*
New iphone 4 day for @asherdryden ;)
@bartka 
Watching a video on how interruptions break flow state while @ashedryden works on CSS. Suddenly feel really guilty about interrupting her.
Thinking about ditching my cellphone plan (i never use voice) for a mifi on verizon and ipad/laptop combo. Thoughts?
Just two kids, dressed up in goth black uniforms, for a romantic stroll in sunny, hoighty-toighty WFB. Seriously, I can't make this stuff up
Potential band name: Popsicles and Potato Salad (via @ashedryden)
Rock the Casbah.
WTF is going on with traffic in Milwaukee today? Everywhere I went the DPW had barricades up and it was stop-go traffic. Never driving again
@KeVroN yep. skype is implied.
OH @ashedryden: "This is a lot of work to make them puke a little less."
@ashedryden Pre-existing work that i am basing mine off of: 
@joshjs Wow, that avatar was used for a long time by someone I used to know. Totally threw me off to see it replying @DDysart in twitter.
Got a shoutout on the blog of @larryclarkin 
Free idea: ninja-waiters.
Watching google tech talks that i preloaded on wifi on @ashedryden's old iphone, during our commute.
We grilled field roast sausages. I smell like a campfire. We wrapped up a project. Today was a good day :D
@ashedryden has a lot more stuff than we thought.  Worried because I have waaaay too much stuff left to pack.
Eating a big bean burrito. #tweetworthy.
RT @joshjs: Getting pretty sick of people who don't own iPhones complaining about the new iPhone. Hey guys, it's actually pretty nice. # ...
@trodrigues morning
Got new glasses in the mail today. They're bigger, stainless steel, and nerdy. Told @ashedryden that I feel like I should go design a font.
Hour and a half at the at&t store. Verdict: they can't help @ashedryden. Total waste of our time.
Store is now closing. Half a dozen people still in line. Maybe if they didn't take an hour to activate a phone, this would go quicker.
The ATT Store is the reason I will never get an iPhone on a contract.
We've been in line at the ATT Store for an hour+ now.
Six AT&T Store employees, 2 actually helping people. huge line. awesome.
You'd think an ATT store would have open wifi to demo their phat pipes. nope.
My tools have changed so much. I need to do an updated "The WI Setup" entry for me with the Changelog.
Anyone know how to rename a PDF in iBooks? I guess I could download the PDF on my computer, rename it, and then email it to myself. Klunky.
@ashedryden that was a food coma and finally having air conditioning conspiring against my awake state.
Moving my desk at work for the 5th time. It's not dictated from on high; I'm just very mobile. I've occupied 1/2 of the desks in the office.
I yawned and I think I dislocated my thyroid.
If you were going to buy a laptop for a small local nonprofit to run Powerpoint on, what would you get them? #lazyweb
@becw We're not too happy with Mediatemple, either.
@becw @DDysart @compujeramey In a shoot-out between Webfaction, Mediatemple, and Slicehost, I may just go with the cheapest Slicehost.
@becw looking into it, thanks!
Trying to be clever will just burn you.
Re-discovered 'trance' tag on last.fm. Digitally Imported defined what I listened to for most of high school. Don't think I am still into it
@ashedryden and I are looking to get her off of Dreamhost and have a shared host for Drupal, blogs, webapps, etc. for cheap. Suggestions?
@ashedryden is talking to a weird chatbot on Time Warner's website: "I can understand how important DOES NOT COMPUTE is to you."
Wrote @ashedryden a note with everything needed to steal my identity. Hopefully she uses it for good (getting utilities turned on), not evil
@ashedryden tweets my life now so that I don't have to, it seems: 
My hackintosh netbook has ceased sleeping and now just runs its battery down as if the lid was open. Need to fix this soon-ish.
Biking home through Riverwest, the heat, humidity and campfire smell reminded me of summer camp years ago.

Can I get a ride to Madison for DrupalCamp Madison either Friday or Saturday?
On the wat to the store, got asked by an old man where the clubs were with single women. I told him I had no idea, I'm no fun. Back to work.

@EighthInch i've been waiting for the raw finish for awhile. Thinking about a Shimano Alfine 8-speed grocery-getter.
Does anyone have a mifi I could borrow for the weekend? Need to take the train to Chicago for a family emergency. Will pay whatever you want
@jeffmke Right. Forgot about that. Have a safe trip!
@mkedave @svdodge Made it safely by riding through downtown. Roads are fine, no puddles to be seen.
@svdodge yeah, figured. The oak leaf by the Comet Cafe runs parallel to a Victorian sewage tunnel higher in elevation & floods to Oak Leaf.
Need to send that over to @littletinyfish and @svdodge too.. just basically asking all the MKE bike folks what they know ;)
@mkedave @jeffmke anything I should avoid on my bike? I have to get from Riverwest to Walker's Point.
I'm still deciding whether I should be flattered when people give me their tricky problems because I can learn the problem faster.
I keep trying to get out and they keep pulling me back in.
Apparently Milwaukee is being washed away by this rainstorm. Giant sinkholes, floods..
@jasongullickson hello, heard you might be doing stuff with node.js from @ckittel.
@miksago node.js IS cool, yes. I should be asking: Who is using or working on node.js? :-)
Anyone doing anything cool with node.js?
Repeat-tweet: If anyone wants some old computer junk, get in touch. I've got lots of cables, a decent Canon inkjet that needs ink, etc.
Aaand, a 15" CRT monitor. Although I think that this going to best buy's computer recycling programs, if I can figure out transportation
I also have a 1.8Ghz Athlon desktop that was my linux box for years, if anyone wants to come pick it up. DM me.
Anyone want an Apple Newton emate? The battery pack is busted. @raster has first dibs. DM me.
Watching googletechtalks while I pack my apartment. hurt my back already
@smutandeggs I wouldn't call that a short ride.
I need food in the Third Ward / Walker's Point / Bayview area. Anyone want to meet up?
@newtontalk @raster picked it up. Thanks for the interest, though.
Considering I puked up some of the first pot of coffee of the day, it probably wasn't the best idea to have more rocket fuel. Oh well.
#lazyweb Best Mac text editor or tool for cleaning up and messing with CSV data? I'm not asking for Excel. Need to strip out newlines, etc.
Pandora for iPhone is so sweet, and sucks so much battery.
Nearly spilled a glass of water on my macmini and both laptops. Gah. *not* how I wanted to spend my Sunday.
@smutandeggs inbox zero.
Rode to @bucketworks. Just threw up. Sprinting, heat, trying to ride in traffic. It's hard to cross 1st Str w/o a stoplight & cars going 40.

@jasongullickson not yet. Have a project that might be fun to use node.js on, though. I need to get other projects done 1st.
o/~ going to comet (cafe), gonna eat a lot french fries o/~
@mkedave that sounds exhausting.
I'll even buy you dinner at @AJBombers afterwards, if you help me move. What a deal! :)
I move on Saturday. Now taking applications for helpers. Will be well-paid in beer, pizza (or my vegan cooking) & my everlasting gratitude.
I think that's the grand finale. Hopefully.
On the porch at @bucketworks, enjoying a cool night with the fireworks going off.
@DanMHamlin Is there beer in Milwaukee? That's like asking if there are fish in the ocean.
Arbitrarily decided to bake bread to use up my remaining flour & yeast. Will bring two loaves to work tomorrow.
Things done: books, bookshelves, winter stuff, cleaning stove. Doing the last dishes now to pack.
When did I acquire so much stuff, anyways? #wtfbbq
Copying over something we do on our (private) microblogging platform at work, for @blissdev: #blissdevisawesome.
Can anyone help me move on Saturday?
RT @technoweenie: how to halt productivity of any programmer: talk to them
Gah. My apartment is such a mess right now (i'm in the middle of a move)
Reminder: There is never such thing as a "simple matter of programming"
Signing the lease to our new apartment in Schuster's Lofts.
Something got on my hands that smells moldy/mildewy. Can't figure out what. Allergies are really bad today.
My dad is telling me a story about going to a party at Obama's house in Hyde Park. In the 70's, long before Obama owned it.
The other side of the Lost Lego diorama: Desmond in the Hatch 
Lego diorama I made at work: Ben Linus moving the island on Lost. 
Something I just said that holds highly true: It's ridiculous that people are still more concerned about TV service than broadband internet.
So completely beyond stressed out.
@svdodge I have at least a box of bike stuff as well. It just isn't packed yet. Oh, and a bike frame.
@svdodge Oh, books. I have boxes and boxes and boxes of books.
@svdodge I am proud of myself, I'm down to one small box of media, including external HDDs for backups, DVDs, CDs, and also blank media.
@littletinyfish so it was *you* who tried to run me off the road. I see how it is.
@svdodge This has been me for the past few weeks. #moving
@littletinyfish That was me. Where were you?
Time to write some code generators *groove to the tune of "Talkin Bout My Generation*
@whil Maybe after I move and work settles down a little? Note to self: I should do this job-shadowing thing with everyone I respect.
@whil One of these days I may request a day to shadow you while you work & code, to absorb knowledge. If that's cool with you?
phone battery died, charger is in the office and I am not. My family is coming to town and I doubt they will see txts sent from Google Voice
Coffee spit take. That mug haz a flavr.
@whil This apartment doesn't have AC.
I think my digital thermostat is broken, because it is reporting that it s 120 degrees F in here.
@raster I can't help making this comment: Your dad's memorial bench is so METAL.
Watching @ashedryden get chewed out for using Skype while her family is all sitting together. Watching her on Skype, that is.
@gregtarnoff it involves the SDK. Fairly certain @abraham and other l33t Android users know how, but it isn't exactly consumer-friendly.
Android Users, send me a screenshot of your phone's home screen.. oh wait.
Stomach status: full of tasty vegan tacos.
Baking bread.
@DanMHamlin Totally. There's The Palomino and Comet Cafe here. Also, @AJBombers is awesome and has vegetarian stuff that can be veganized.
@whil I'd feel really guilty making you carry stuff, anyways, since your joints are liable to explode under load.
Apartment status: mostly packed but lots to do. 
I've also got a lot of bike stuff for the Bike Collective. Need to figure out a way to donate it; no transportation & no storage at new apt.
Bags of trash taken out of my apt: 4. Bags of clothes going to Goodwill: 2. Boxes of books & CDs going to halfprice: 2. still too much stuff
Completely exhausted. Time to go get some vegan tacos from the RW Coop.
Packing status: food all packed, dishes all washed and drying (to pack), clothes in the dryer (also to pack tonight)
At VIA because my dad is such a fan of Transfer that we had to try the sequel ;)
Anyone want to help me move on Saturday? I might let you drive a big truck. And buy you pizza, beer, etc.
Gah. Not enough time in a day: 
@abraham That's Square, right? I guess I could've just googled it, but the haircuts part stuck in my brain for some reason.
My new apartment is only five blocks from @milwaukeebikeco. Win!
@gregtarnoff A hammer?
@mariehuynh I'm gonna move her stuff & wait for her to get back to move the cats. Pretty sure the cats don't want to ride in a UHaul anyways
@DDysart oh man. I can remember scribbling down a note when that first came out and I heard it: "Knights of Cydonia -&gt; personal themesong"
@mariehuynh I think this is the weekend when everyone moves. Me, @ashedryden, @svdodge and a few other people I know are all moving.
on the porch at my apartment in riverwest, downing an energy drink and putting in a few more hours of code before I have to pack more stuff.
Getting some protein before moving at the RW Coop.
I feel like the Internet's janitor with all these keys
@svdodge lamesauce :(
My furniture looks pretty good with most of my stuff packed away. If only I had less stuff...
@smutandeggs we will have to ride some time before the summer is over!
@smutandeggs your new bike looks awesome.
Red Leader, standing by.
Nice surprise: the Internet worked at my new place right after plugging in the modem. Hooray for not having to wait for Time Warner to come.
I am the master of all that i sorbet.
So glad to be done moving. Now: unpacking!
All done moving! Thanks to @chrisgauger, @jennaddenda and @hypnagogic!
Time to go pick up a big-ass truck and finish moving. Exhausted.
At the Racine County Fair. The fun never ends :P
The bathroom at this bar is like a piss sauna. Ugh.
So exhausted. Done moving though and only a little unpacking left. My arms and back are shot.
@svdodge Where did you move to?
The tendons in my hands/fingers hurt from carrying boxes for the past three days. It hurts to type.
How can I still be tired after two Redbulls? Gah. Damnit.
Sign in bayview: "i am in love with your mom. We are having a rummage sale!"
Our internet connection keeps going out. The cable guy hasn't been out yet to turn it on, so the fact that it works at all is a fluke.
@littletinyfish I might be up for the Scavenger Ride on Friday.
@svdodge nice!
@hypnagogic my fortune cookie:

@svdodge The nub is not a killer feature for me. The unibody MBP's trackpad is.
@svdodge Ugly design, even if they are utilitarian. Even the Ideapads that try to rip off the Macbook look.
Take a look at this visualization of all the commits to the Drupal project on Github:  #visualizations #git #awesomeness
Pretty sure no one else makes a laptop with the quality of a Macbook Pro. MBPs are a solid, designed object. PCs feel like cheap tupperware.
@matthusby That'd be a hilarious and dangerous way to commute by bike.
@bitfyre I have a hackintosh dell mini 9 that is not cutting it for heavy dev work or driving 23" widescreen LCDs, unfortunately.
@raster Not torture. Just that I train people to use tools on Windows.
@Giania smartphone?

@raster Interarchy 10 is out. woot?
Finally parked at the State Fair, one hour later.

@raster Well, it could be Perl, or whatever. The point is that you get better at both? ;)
Any interest in a blog post with this title? "Cross-Train Your Developer Skills To Get Better (Write Ruby to generate PHP)"
@raster I really need to start blogging again. Except I lost the files to feed to jekyll to generate blog.mattgauger.com (templates, etc)
If your DNS TTL was previously set to 4 hrs, don't blame me for delay in new site appearing. I can't rush every computer on earth #justayin'
@raster yeah. I want to talk more about what people do to get their jobs done.. which sounds strangely familiar to something you did ;-)
@raster keep getting promises for more, but none yet. I am tempted to change the format, too. As many have noted, hardware gets outdated.
So iBooks is really borked.  
Day 3 of the experiment: following at least 80 more people. Having the wifi-only iPhone with Tweetie on it helps to stay on top of the noise
Drinking iced coffee in the sunshine in our new apartment. Sitting next to @ashedryden at our shared (for now) desk.
House is 99% unpacked. That's a lot of stress relief.
@smutandeggs My typical breakfast on a day I'll be riding lots is 2c (dry) of oatmeal. I also eat a lot of beans, whole grain pasta, quinoa.
I feel bad for making @ashedryden vacuum so much (and we have a roomba, but it doesn't get everything) but my allergies are killing me.
Me: can I 'view source' on a webpage on an iPhone? @ashedryden: I don't think so. Me: damn it!
@smutandeggs look into protein shakes. Just not the whey-based 'body builder' ones like they sell at GNC. Those are gross.
@svdodge the intro-rate TW (Roadrunner) 7mbps, $24.95 a month, like @compujeramey said.
@compujeramey srsly not pleased with their service, and they're just not offering me anything worth staying for.

@Arlen Not necessarily looking to find a "better X" I don't have a lot of confidence in my coding knowledge & don't feel like I'm improving.
@Arlen Just curious, but what would you recommend given what I was describing?
@Arlen Same goes for Javascript and PHP I've done.
@Arlen I don't know. I haven't felt  accomplished in anything I've coded in a year. Burn-out + constantly looking for something better?
@Arlen I feel the same way, but I don't feel comfortable in Ruby anymore.

I just won 90's Trivial Pursuit against @ashedryden. This is unprecedented.

@blissdev that's what we were watching, yeah.
Adding @auzigog to my drupal-rockstars list. Good job on the #GSoC dude!
I may just go with Corolla for my blog's theme, even though we just used it on the  site. #drupal #bcmke #zomg
Looking for a minimal Drupal 7 theme. Yes, D7 is in alpha, but stable enough for my blog. Yes, I could write a theme, I just don't want to.
@whil That's not good. The G4 part, I mean.
As far as I can tell, this is the only difference between  and  
@usesthis wow, awesome!
@Arlen ouch!
@whil It does make a very nice ultraportable web browser / email / SSH machine though.
@whil macmini is my home desktop. The Dell netbook just isn't powerful enough for me.
New desk setup at home with all the cables hidden. Big difference.

@ashe I'm not complaining that BarCampChicago is this weekend, it's just that they're all at once. 'Tis the season to be BarCamp, I guess.
RT @cjibo: Why does #barcampchicago have to be this weekend?
Terrible headache, house is out of coffee, Alterra is too far to bike on a headache. Switching to Redbull.
@ashedryden The problem is we've already ruled out every restaurant on Yelp.
@BookSuggest Just curious. A "suggest more" link might be easier for the enduser. If it doesn't have anything, just say "Check back later!"
@avanhizzle agreed. We've used it in a lot of different dishes.
@WMSE I enjoyed listening to that today, too.

@BookSuggest Will it ever re-grab my Twitter feed & suggest new books, or is it only the 6 listed? Would rather have 10-20 books recommended
@DDysart awesome!
@matthusby @trodrigues Awesome. Thanks. Time to go buy a new MBP.. well, when I have saved enough money.
@Arlen You don't need to sleep, right?
#lazyweb: Does the headphone port on newer Macs let you use the mic on a pair of iPhone earbuds?
@jasongullickson Only if it is your first.. And I've been to two BarCamps in Madison alone ;-)
@DrupalGitGremln not bad!
@jasongullickson I wasn't planning on presenting at BarCamp Madison, but I'd could co-present on these. If you need anything, let me know.
@DrupalGitGremln 4 minutes or 4 hours?
@jasongullickson I've read it, and parts of it stuck, but I haven't refered back. Maybe it is time for a re-read before BarCamp Madison.
Also looking forward to @jasongullickson's "Cross-platform mobile app development with jqtouch ( session.
@Arlen @jasongullickson I've played with node.js & it pointed out how poorly I know Javascript outside of writing jQuery glue.
Looking forward to this BarCamp Madison session by @jasongullickson: Give an intro/tech talk/demo of node.js 
@Arlen Also: to all the ASP.NET people just now getting into the MVC framework thing, it might be exotic. Dunno. Depends on the audience.
@avanhizzle The celebration roast is what we use at Thanksgiving now. Tofurkey ftl.
@Arlen Leave it up to the day-of. It's a matter of whether there's room for scheduling it against other sessions you'd like to attend.
@Arlen Depends on how you use it. I'm sure there's people out there using it purely as a RoR DSL that never get into metaprogramming, etc.
@avanhizzle We've looked at online grocery delivery & Amazon, but haven't it cheaper than Outpost. This place has it:

@littletinyfish like.
Oh hai 
@avanhizzle chipotle is nice and spicy, but not too smokey or salty. They're soaked in chili oil.
@ashedryden's cat Murray has stopped begging for food and started begging for the laser pointer. He's addicted to chasing the red dot.
@trodrigues Frequently answers are: "Do it this (wrong) way" or "Use this library" on stackoverflow, yeah. I tend to ignore it.
New laser pointer + cats means that productivity in this house just went to zero.
The AC is so powerful that it blows stuff off my desk. Like Javascript: The Good Parts.
OH @ashedryden "Is our internet down? Facebook's not loading for me." Me: "Yeah.. I blocked it."
My twitter avatar needs a bunch of twibbons. Like 5 of them.

@oleg_tumarkin The guy who was interested was looking to meet with C++ folks. I think C# culture is closer to Java, no C/C++ ancestry felt.
@KeVroN I will email pic.
@raster If I wasn't already promising to do 5 or 6 sessions, I'd be up for helping with that. I'm a serious photography n00b.
Sad to see that  isn't a cool VOIP startup.
@raster Have the world's best hammer =&gt; will find nails, I guess ;)
A week ago, node.js had different libraries for doing stuff than it does now, and my mailing list backlog unread runs 7 days old or so :/
@blissdev Probably not. Thanks for the offer, though. Wil see if @ashedryden wants to take you up on that offer.
I kinda want to play Starcraft 2 now. Can't justify the price at this time, though.
@ashedryden has a new torture device that pulls hair out by means of a rotating toothed cylinder. The lengths girls go to for beauty :(
@corbenfrost 32Gb iPhone 3GS with a camera, even without a contract/SIM card, is so much more useful and capable, yeah.
@ashedryden It's a touchscreen that's bigger than my netbook. Does everything no-contract iPhone 3GS does but bigger &faster. Needs a camera

@Arlen math is hard, let's build websites!!!
@veryfancy There's a bunch of more-web2.0-y features along with a lot of the NoSQL DBs like CouchDB, supporting REST calls & JSON enclosures
@veryfancy Obviously, it is an area that can be debated and the definitions of what 'NoSQL' is are fluid.
Oops, that was @veryfancy.
@joshjs Similarly, all your documents in NoSQL could have the same fields. It's really about optimizing and scaling. NoSQL can decentralize.
@joshjs You can, of course, try to do the same thing in a relational database by just making more key/pair tables and foreign keys, afaik.
@veryfancy Unstructured data that you wouldn't necessarily use relationally - stuff you're not JOINing, etc. There's more, will find links.

@bitfyre @blissdev how do we reboot the Javascript Meetup now? :)
@ckittel @cjibo Is there a little scripting language for making small, fun stuff on android? Don't want full-blown app development.
@bitfyre @RandyFrehse This really added another reason to be crabby to my day.
@ralphholzmann seriously, this sucks. I wasn't given any warning, I was presenting on the 16th. I would've at least grabbed a list of users.
@cheshster Did you get an EVO 4g?
@ericaconway did anyone contact you about the Javascript Users Group being cancelled?
Someone took over the Milwaukee Javascript User's Group on meetup.com, kicked everyone out, and closed down the group. 
@TWCableHelp Yes, will email you in a bit with a few. We're telecommuting, so I had to make sure I wasn't interrupting @ashedryden's work.
@cheshster You mean this flash would be *usable* on an Android phone? Just pointing out the silliness of not having a flash-less mobile site
@TWCableHelp And yes, my desktop (macmini) is connected via gigabit ports + high-quality cable. Ping to router is 0.3ms, to modem 0.6ms
@TWCableHelp Is it possible there intermittent problems with the signal strength? Rebooting the modem every hour is not the solution.
This is why I couldn't get an Android phone from Verizon today. Guess I'll be sticking with iPhones. 
The cat just ripped my favorite shirt. The caffeine one. Thanks, @tafferinspace :(
@TWCableHelp I have been monitoring the bandwidth during such a drop in signal:  The scale is roughly 15 minutes in time
@TWCableHelp TW Tech Support last night could not see any issue from their end at the time, and so there was no resolution.
@TWCableHelp Yes. Our connection drops every hour or so. The solution should not be to reset the modem, it suggests a deeper problem.
@tomhenrich @jennaddenda I think there should be railing.
Anyone out there want to help me improve a regex?
@svdodge The new iPod nano, sorry.
@Oddessy thanks!
I think everyone is missing the important point that the new iPod will make the worst alarm clock ever.
@cheshster Apple wants to tuck me in at night? Wow.
@ashedryden to her cat Murray: "No, no, it's cool. Don't let me interrupt your workflow here." as he lays across her laptop and keyboard.
@ckittel 1 hour, I'm pretty sure.
@ajbombers what day is best this week for a birthday party? :)
@alexfalkenberg awesome! congrats :D and yes, some might say it is the BEST day of the year to have a birthday.
@cheshster thanks! I will continue to sit on my porch and shake my cane at people, old or not.
@alexfalkenberg Oh nice. Sounds about right.
@phillijw It drops every couple minutes to the point that all traffic times out. I can see it on the DD-WRT's bandwidth grapher.
@comcastcares please take over the Milwaukee area, Time Warner sucks and we accept you as our new internet overlords.
@alexfalkenberg @Arqueete @ashedryden The best part is, you can complain all you want on Twitter because they don't know it exists.
@ashedryden So not impressed. We need a "yes, I know how the internet works, in fact, I know the  OSI 7 layer model" button for tech support
Trying to explain how we can see the bandwidth across the wire on our DD-WRT router to tech support is not going to work, I don't think.
More reason why our internet is slow: We're using Internet Explorer (uh, on a Mac?!), we need to clear our cookies, Google.com must be down.
Meanwhile, we have a brand new DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem, ASUS's fastest little draft-N router running DD-WRT, and fast Macs. Uh, yeah, no.
TW's excuses for why our internet is slow: modem is too old, our router is old, our computers must have spyware (we run Macs) or are too old
The overlooked thing about Firefly isn't just that it is a space western. It is more properly identified as *zombie* space western.

Waiting for the @ashedryden to return to el apartmento.
@chernowa iPhone or Android. I'm just curious
Even better would be one that mutes the music to read me tweets.
Is there a Twitter client that reads me tweets from certain folks while I drive / walk / etc?
I am not so sure @ashedryden will like this curry when she gets home ,though.
I made kitchen sink curry (every veggie we had, basically) status: tasty. eatability: high.

@fragmad what is it about? Amazon keeps recommending it to me.
Wow. Everyone is driving like an idiot today. Go figure.

Brown rice, quinoa, and black beans with salsa for lunch. Yummy.
@jeffmke That's funny, it'd be quite a demanding ride for me right now. I'm out of shape :(
@gregtarnoff Only 4G in some parts of Chicago. There won't be 4G in Milwaukee for a long time, because I couldn't find any plans for it.
@sfradkin In the long run of a 2 year contract, the actual phone is cheap. $145/month (or 1/2: $70/month) seems outrageous for what I use.
@sfradkin Until the Palm Pre gets a hardware refresh and the new version of WebOS, I don't really know that it does everything I want.
Maybe the best thing to do is to wait for a Retina display & camera model of the iPad. $800 (iPad) + 24*$30 (data plan for 2 years) = $1520.
@darrickhartman Exactly.
Oh, and for everyone suggesting sprint / an evo 4g: Cost of 4G service on Sprint over 2 yrs: $2160.
The only thing about all this is how depressing it is the amount it'd cost me over 2 years, and how sucky all the phones really are.
AT&T contract w/data for 2yrs: $1920. Verizon family plan w/data for 2 yrs: $1440. Virgin Mobile mifi for 2 yrs: $960. Cost of phone is moot
@rohdesign thanks Mike! :-)
RT @DDysart: Alright, let's here it for sleep deprivation!  Give me a Z! Give me another Z!   (no seriously)
Good morning. Didn't sleep yet.
Of course, 'unlimited' means 5 gigabytes in cellphone company speak.
I hate that phones require a voice and txt plan. I'd rather just get unlimited data and use GTalk/GVoice/Skype. I don't talk on the phone.
Correction: We're watching Sneakers tonight. We've seen Hackers. .@ashedryden
I think @ashedryden's cats are determined to destroy my stuff. Just saying.
When we call the ISP's phone support, it sounds like they don't pull up the notes on our account. @ashedryden explaining it all over again.
@KatieFelten I've used an iPhone 4 extensively (@ashedryden has one) but the latest Android phones have the CPUs and screen res to compete.
Seriously just tired of this problem & ranting about it. We moved over a month ago. Just need a reliable internet connection to keep sanity.
Phone support has been all but useless, in-person techs say there is no issue. ISP has a twitter account that was helpful but can't do much.
@phillijw Pings across gigabit wired network are 0.3ms. Pings to google are 200ms. Time Warner always says they can't see a signal issue.
@phillijw Yep, the problem is that it drops every hour or more often, while we're using it. Rebooting the modem hourly isn't a solution.
@phillijw Rebooting modem doesn't help. Can't exactly replace the modem with random equipment I've got laying around.
@phillijw We just bought a brand new pre-N router and a brand new DOCSIS 2.0/3.0 cable modem. time warner thinks the modem may be defective.
Our internet is continously down again and rebooting the cable modem does nothing. So tired of this bullshit.
Virgin Mobile USA should have an Android phone. I'd jump on that unlimited data plan oh-so-fast.
Nothing against Android users, but I've been really trying to find a reason why I'd rather get one & haven't found one. AT&T still sucks etc
Twitter seems to have lost my avatar. Need to dig up another one, as I lost the file I uploaded, as well.
@phillijw I'm on Verizon, but have no reason to stay, as I'm at month-to-month status. Nothing entirely compelling about the Droid X.
Gah. I know I've been talking/complaining about it for the past few days, but I need a new phone. And I really don't want to go with AT&T.
@ashedryden was on my phone, and gave every action + buttonpress a ringtone. Not awesome.

@cjibo I was planning to just do my own thing, but if you guys want to brainstorm, look at code, or run bot matches, that'd be awesome.
@antifuchs Have not seen additional work to ship a li-ion powered device. like a sticker on the box, or a different shipping method, etc.
@jeffmke You have to pay? I missed that part.

@matthusby @Arlen @cjibo Milwaukee Hacker House is on Saturday night and I'd love to meet up and talk to you guys about this contest.
@matthusby Totally. Although I'm already swamped with work, organizing meetups + MKE Hacker House, and writing 5-6 presos for @barcampmke.
@cjibo @Arlen I predict that this Galcon version will need more advanced algorithms than just optimized packing/filling decision trees.
@Arlen @cjibo Post-mortem on his win:  great read.

Hoping that our Internet problems are now resolved.
@thelarch definitely. Let me know when you're free. Downtown, third ward and bayview are all a short bike ride from where I live now.
@darrickhartman @cswingler Signal to the box was good. There were a lot of bad splitters, loose ends, & pinched cables. They replaced a lot
In the words of the Mythbusters: "Well there's your problem right there.." cable fittings in the wall were bad. More problems likely.
Time Warner techs are here. Hopefully there is some resolution.
@darrickhartman That is, call my bluff on not knowing what "the amplifier in this neighborhood" means or why it would be important. *shrugs*
@darrickhartman TW technician is on his way right now. I will ask about the amplifier in this neighborhood, hopefully he won't call my bluff
Internet is completely out. Rebooting modem doesn't work. This sucks so much.
@tapps Well, you'd have to add the bit that emails it, but I thought that might be a cool way to do import.
@tapps You could set up a screen scraper and email them to posterous with this:

@tomhenrich I want to see a foreword to a coding book by Edward James Olmos titled: "Do your job."
@blissdev @veryfancy If you can find it, get a copy of Code Generation in Action. Worth the read.
@veryfancy  @blissdev Yeah, Design Patterns is very much stuck in its era/lang. I prefer broader ideas, which Pragmatic Programmer provides.
@blissdev I've got a copy of Design Patterns on my shelf if you want to borrow it.
@veryfancy @blissdev I'd argue that both of those missed the 'Patterns' boat, but they are great for professional coding information.

@cjibo Yes, I noticed it was mostly unusable and couldn't interact with it, probably due to the need for a real mouse cursor and keyboard.

"I see you brought your lady friend,"	-- @ashedryden, referring to my phone's female GPS navigation voice.
My dad sent me some links to the Journal Sentinel, but called it the Milwaukee JS. To which I thought: we should make a milwaukee.js script.
Things I'd like to talk to people at BarCamp about: starting startups (entrepreneurs), Lisp, being a professional software developer.
Wow, a startup that manages those "We're launching soon, put your email here to be notified" pages for startups: 
@svdodge don't get sucked down that rabbithole of reading your old email. I've been there, it's bad.
@svdodge GCal isn't reactive and able to store information, or I'd have it ping me with lots of reminders that would have me fill in details
@svdodge My GMail All Mail only has 22K items in it. Goes back to June 2004. By all accounts, I don't get much email.
@svdodge My google calendar has 68ish items on it for this week alone, though.
@svdodge the real question is, how many items are on your google calendar? (and do recurring events count, since mine go on forever)
@Arlen Solution was to pull out the body of the try into a method and write an error handler function for the catch that can be generalized.
Trying to get to that sweet, sweet 300K item limit in GReader: "Since April 27, 2007 you have read a total of 246,126 items."
@Arlen True, there's multiple interpretations to that statement. I'm just not a fan of try-catch blocks, which is what I was referring to.
I believe in separation of code and error handling.
Resty, a shell built on top of cURL to help you with REST APIs 
@blissdev IMDB says it is over 2 hours long, so the 4PM or 1:30PM showtimes would be best. BarCamp Milwaukee Pre-Party starts at 7PM.
@svdodge I use Jumpcut.app for nearly-unlimited copy/paste buffer on Mac.
Anyone want to go see The Social Network before the barcamp pre-party tomorrow? Showtimes on the southside at 1:30PM, 4PM, 6PM.
The Emacs keystroke data question comes from the fact that I already buffer copy history back 2000 lines. I want to store everything I type.
Emacs users: I was remembering a quote by an Emacs/Lisp guy that said he had 20 years of keystroke data from Emacs. What's that mode called?
so, I've ported over almost all of my old blog posts to mathiasx.posterous.com That's over 4 blogs worth of content!
We're going to Boston in October. What do you recommend for non-touristy, geeky things to do? Would like to see as much history as possible.
You can't even tell that I cleaned this whole apartment two days ago.
@tafferinspace is crabby and decided my keyboard is his. Attempts to type are met with attempts to eat my hands.
@blissdev I'll probably have time to work on it overnight at BarCamp. @raster has agreed to host TheWISetup, so we may migrate that as well.
@aaronsaray just curious, why the veggie intake lately?
@blissdev I'm seeing a suspicious line added to the (very simple) markup of mattgauger.com look for the &lt;ads&gt; tag.
@svdodge yes. Let's make this the Best. BarCamp. Ever. and do everything that anyone has ever wanted to do.
@blissdev Getting trojan/malware warnings from the box that mattgauger.com and your other sites are hosted on, from Google. Weird.

@ickyb0d I never moved my .vimrc & .vim/ to this machine. Browsing for vim themes&plugins is a timesink that I'm afraid to let myself start.

@nikulr definitely. They aren't far off when they call it the film about this decade.
The Social Network was good. Great weekend. Thanks to everyone at #bcmke5. As @heygabe said, it was truly a homecoming for our tribe.
Just got here
Me to @ashedryden: "By your criteria, we should put You've Got Mail! on this list. Seriously."
@ckittel we started & could not finish that documentary. I didn't feel I needed a documentary, I've lived the Linux movement.
@ashedryden  You better lawyer up because I'm coming back for EVERYTHING
@joshjs I picked those two originally, tyvm.
@ckittel YES! I have been meaning to show that one to Ashe.
You guys should hear me disparaging @ashedryden's choice of The Net on the list.
@blissdev random sidenote, but The Social Network might be the one good, decent, realistic movie about startups
@blissdev totally, but if becomes general science fiction, then I can recommend dozens of movies.. Dune, Star Wars, Back to the Future etc
Me, shouting at @ashedryden "NO, that movie was terrible. YOU SHOULDN'T RECOMMEND MOVIES THAT WERE BAD."
@blissdev Originally this was the movies I was showing @ashedryden to educate her on the 80's coder-geek movies, but her list is broader...
@raster it was hilarious
@raster THAT WAS A TERRIBLE MOVIE. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
Huh, Melanie from Hey Dude! was the blonde reporter in Zoolander and the girl who wasn't Drew Barrymore in The Wedding Singer.
@cthielen We've got Hackers on the list for nostalgia, but also: Pirates of Silicon Valley, Wargames, Sneakers, The IT Crowd (hon. mention)
@svdodge not true. you play DnD!
Hey guys, any recommendations for the Geek Film Festival? @ashedryden  and I are putting together a list.
@heygabe on youtube, just hit refresh quick.
@raster Is this where you got the name for your company? 
Free business idea: laundromat w with a yoga studio. At the laundromat, you're already in comfy clothes and you've got 45+ minutes to kill.
@ashedryden @blissdev lines of code per hour, defects per line, etc are all wothless indicator of quality. It'd be hard to tell, if ever.
@blissdev possible. We need scientific evidence, though.

@WorkingWriter I've had #newtwitter since it was indie. It's sold out since.
Retro goodtimes is over. Time to go back to #newtwitter. (which I now think of as just twitter)
Fun's over. Back to #oldtwitter everyone!
@darrickhartman but I'd lose the shiny!
Damn you, #newtwitter. Your DMs are so broken. I'm using my Android phone over #newtwitter these days.
@ashedryden's cat Murray is eating her keys. He wants to show us how much he's starving.
@plural This looks really interesting. his talk at SXSW: 
@samwisethegreat gets annoyed ar the volume of my  speakers, flexes his foot, and hit the volume-down button. 
@jennaddenda They're people now, right?
In a multi-day funk. It has become apparent that I've been a jerk to @ashedryden over that time. Angry at everything, need to snap out of it
@WorkingWriter hope you like it. I thought it was great ;)
@chrisjaure It's $1/mile, plus you have to fill it back up pretty much past what they say it was at, to make them happy. Not a scam, just $$
@plural That Jason Scott video was good, so I grabbed his BBS Documentary. Also, I want to see this:

@aaronsaray sleeping poorly is an evolutionary advantage, like stress. No longer required in modern society.
I can OH someone in real time with speech recognition on my phone. Who's.
@aaronsaray the one thing I don't believe in is medication to improve sleep. Doctors don't always agree with me on that.
@aaronsaray I think moving around is part of what Zeo monitors. Moving too much = inadequate sleep. You may need a new bed or pillow?
@aaronsaray I'm looking at it as a quality-of-life improver.If it works & I can get 1-2 more hours of being productive, it'll pay for itself
@aaronsaray nice :)
@aaronsaray raw veggies and fruit are real food :P
Thinking about saving for a Zeo sleep coach/alarm clock. It uses an EEG headband to monitor your sleep.  thoughts?
@cjibo That is quite the look
@svdodge we'd be up for that. Where/when should we meet you?
@ashedryden just asked me if she could suck the fluid out of her own lungs  with a straw. I told her I don't think lungs work like that
Wow. Here's a blog post with only spam comments:  You'd think they'd want to clean that up (don't click the usernames)

I'm going to a Meetup with Milwaukee PHP Users Group! 
@mkepug @aaronsaray Paste names from all 3 sites of attending folks in a .txt file, then $ cat list.txt | uniq | sort | tee &gt;(wc -l) | cat
@mkepug @aaronsaray I'd just say, use your website to do RSVP's, Facebook, and Meetup. Then average those out.
@mkepug Also, if you're tracking on meetup.com, not everyone uses it, and requiring 5+ questions to join the group is kind of heinous.
@matthusby Aha. It scrolled off to page 2 already.
@smutandeggs Steve Wozniak? I am interested, but it depends on time-of-day.
@mkepug Link to RSVP? ;) I'll be there.
@matthusby Got a better link to the HN article? Don't know your HN username.
@tomhenrich When @ashedryden says "some people have a lot of stuff" she means me. But, we have furniture *because* I have a lot of stuff.
@smutandeggs ashe and I will be there!
@raster I imagine he will be talking about that. Also, @danvoell is on the panel.

@svdodge @littletinyfish Tearing down the Hoan also lets the neighborhood on its north end expand for the first time since it was built.
@littletinyfish Be sure to get @compujeramey's take on it. Jeramey knows what this city needs better than anyone else.

@gilesgoatboy a lesson for the ages. #gitftw
@Arlen merge is your friend.
@Arlen For the kids playing along at home, you should specify, to mirror one git repo to two SVN remotes, where the SVN remotes don't talk.
@Arlen wow, that's far more complicated than I would have thought it should be.
@mkedave Glad to hear you don't need surgery. Here's to our remarkably reliable human bodies ;) #cheers
@darrickhartman @raster The other nice thing is if you can budget in an SSD of some sort. A small one will work for a home server boot drive
@joshdean Oh, and the Repeater Repeater Factory is a Singleton, of course.
@joshdean I put a Repeater Repeater Factory in my architecture astronaut framework. if you need it.
@raster @darrickhartman Mini-ITX Atom should do nicely. Cutting out the windowing manager / UI really lets a netbook crunch.

I'm not so good at this whole brain thing, apparently. Is it possible to buy a better one?
@mkepug @jclermont When are those slides going to be up?

@listrophy I use markdown for most of my content, including how I write in simplenote.  is all markdown in jekyll
@listrophy (fatfingered Reply button) I was using Haml to make a skeleton layout to design against. It forced me to rethink and simplify.
@listrophy I wasn't trying too make that claim, sorry for
@tomhenrich But, but, but's broken!
Wait, I can't go to an IP:port in the abdroid browser. I'll have to investigate, that can't be true.
Haml generates markup far more elegantly than I can be trusted to on my own. I tend to overcomplicate.
The best laid plans... always fail for me.
Tea, coding, zen.
Anyone have a referral code for Linode they'd like me to use?
Crafting a skeleton of HTML onto which I will hang my mad styles. Ok, I'm going a little crazy. #webdeveloper not #webdesigner obviously.

Wow. @ashedryden got me good there.

@cjibo May be relevant:  lots of people there seeking the same thing & can answer your questions.
@ashedryden says "This is weird about @tafferinspace" and aims his butt at me. While I'm eating. Lovely.

@trodrigues True. My netbook isn't quite powerful enough to run VirtualBox, in any case ;)
@trodrigues I may want to set up one of our extra desktop machines as a local dev server w/ config mirroring production servers via puppet.
Now I want a bunch of extra linux boxes with a screen attached to them, all talking through the hub that is my hackintosh netbook.
Set up a spare box with Ubuntu and Synergy, connected to my netbook at work. Using it to read documentation. Copy/paste works w/ Jumpcut.app
@tomhenrich thanks for the warning. Luckily, I'm pretty content with Amp sugarfree and Rockstar sugarfree.
And now, for something completely different: (hopefully) uninterrupted sleep cycle.
@Strabd yes, @travisgoodspeed. I should have @raster update the file+metadata. It was an awesome talk. I'm sad that I missed the real thing.
@Strabd Ah. This is.. and I've forgotten his name already. He was with @skipp? I'm terrible at names.
@svdodge or can you speed up?!
11,000 tweets! (this is 11,001)
Listening to @Strabd's #bcmke5 session ( & reading an article on yuiblog.com at the same time. Brain-flow highly synced
Are you reading my new blog? No? Well that's because I haven't put much there yet. Check it out: 
Superhydrophobic carbon nanotubes and water (hint: water is super cool in slow motion) 
Haven't been this excited about a new project in a long time.
@aaronsaray They say that every year about the flu, don't they?
Scifi futureality in which shamans shake a box of bacteria to observe rather than throwing dice or looking at entrails: 
@ashedryden is sick with the stomach flu, and according to the cashiers at Walgreens, this one is nasty.
Smells like a house fire.
Going out late to Walgreens: always an adventure.
@tapps @ajbombers I think the menu is simple enough that an order can fit in 140 characters. I could stick a demo app on Google AppEngine ;)
@jennaddenda @romke @MagnoliaMKE I'll be there.
@plural And yes, I can even burn you a copy.
@plural Just found out we leave the 21st. Hopefully Google-Chicago didn't move a showing on account me ? :/

OH @ashedryden: "Is that a hangman thing over on that building? Like, for hanging people?" Me: "That's a light on a wooden pole." Ashe: "Oh"
Currently in need of a hoodie. Recommend me the most awesomest hoodie ever. #lazyweb
@matthusby Already went back to Gitbox from Gity. I needed Gitbox as a remote/local-branch powertool. Also Gity key combos didn't make sense
What's the best resource (book, website, other) to learn about Google Analytics? #lazyweb
@SaraSantiago I need that right now. If you could send it over to my desk, that'd be great

@bitfyre The print is from @LovesickRobot buy their stuff, they're great people. #FF also, they have Star Wars stormtrooper stuff that rocks
This photo reminded me to hang the poster in the last tweet: 
I need to get a frame so I can hang this above my desk. 
@matthusby that's really cool.
@matthusby How does nginx compare to Apache under heavy load for complicated PHP pages?
@Narkalant awesome little dude.
@bitfyre nginx is an experiment that @IsleUntoHimself & I plan to try. We run a LAMP stack because it was already hosting other prod sites.
@raster @thebestsophist However, if you wait for Atrium 1.0, you'll get a stable featureset. We've had a few issues w/betas changing stuff.
@tafferinspace is still in love with my shoebox. He doesn't sleep in regular kitty beds.
@raster @thebestsophist It's drupal, organic groups, casetracker, the basics (views, cck, context) If you know those, you can customize it.
I'm at Fifth Ward Foundry Alterra in Milwaukee, WI 
Running Sinatra (Rack/Thin) and Redis on my netbook doesn't consume 100% CPU like running Apache & MySQL does. Great little dev env #devmke

On my way to the Foundry Alterra.
@antifuchs We meet at BarCamp Milwaukee
@DDysart They start marketing politics to kid so early these days.

@atomicfork Awesome space. So much possibility and great people in that community.
At the Sector67 hackerspace opening party. I think this will be the year that we remember when the US hackerspace movement went nonlinear.
Epic mustache sighting. Party is now /on/
@ckittel Ruby devrs often use both BDD/TDD together in a "circle": BDD defines app functionality then TDD for the details to pass BDD test.
@ckittel behavior driven development. Uses user stories. I think it would work with what you're doing with agile/scrum/etc.
@jclermont that's unacceptable.
@ckittel More like not-BDD-tonight. I hacked on it and then added the story. Models are easy to test; BDD webapp functionality not so much.
@joshdean what would you get?
Holy crap, @droplr got a two-letter domain: 
@Arqueete Geocities used to be great. especially when it was composed of "neighborhoods" and you had to pick a street address for your site.

Man, when is Madison-Milwaukee's high speed rail going to be completed? I gots things to do in Madison.
@tomhenrich we might be interested, especially if we carpool somehow. Worries me that it is limited seating to general public.
Me: "It's the zombie apocalypse and these guys are just sitting at home and watching TV." Ashe: "What would you do?" Me: "Go fight zombies!"
I think @ashedryden has finally figured out that I'm weird.
Watching "Last of the Living" a NZ zombie movie. Available on Netflix streaming. Pretty decent for a budget film, and has its funny moments.
@cthielen @ashedryden I can be much louder than they can, in response to something-that-just-happened-in-sports.
Actually I'll just resort to blowing a virtual vuvuzela every time they shout. Through a 100 watt amp.
The guys next door are really loud, watching football and shouting. So it's time to troll them with the worst music on the internet.
Didn't realize yesterday that I was out of coffee. Please send caffeine, I may not last much longer.
@tomhenrich and they don't filter effectively and aggressively
Suddenly feeling exhausted.
@sfradkin Like I said, TDDing data models is usually easy.. other functionality gets really tricky really fast. @ckittel
@jclermont You should come to the Ruby User's Group on Monday night, then. We're anti-frustration in our language choices ;)
@usesthis Did you change your CSS significantly? Font looks.. chunky. Firefox 3.6.10, Mac OS X. Example: 
@trodrigues not true imho. Dell Mini9 supports all hardware and can be installed with a stock Snow Leopard image on USB. 
@trodrigues lol yeah. best hackintosh ever.
@trodrigues @matthusby I'm quite tempted to just replace it all with one late model macmini and dual 24" LCDs. Far cheaper than a MacbookPro
@trodrigues @matthusby There are 2 DVI ports per linux box (there's 2 now) & 3 other Linux desktops to recruit. The sky's the limit!
@trodrigues 19" 4:3 Dell? Yeah, it weighs more than my 24" widescreen Dell ST2410 at home. @matthusby
@raster probably.
@usesthis awesome! didn't know that.  @raster
@thebestsophist @tomhenrich I propose a meetup; but I hesitate to blanket this as "technical writing." Perhaps fuckyeahgeekswithwords.mke
@ashedryden We already have @rubymke. More interested in interacting with the Ruby communities all over the place ;)
@trodrigues @matthusby Finally got a pic of my setup:  time to get some 24" LCDs I think.

@rubymke is tonight! At Bucketworks! Come get your Ruby on! 
Basically, I want it to manage groups of settings and software to start/stop (including commandline tools) depending on location it detects.
Is there a settings app for OSX that, when I get into the office, would make my laptop switch the dock location & boot up a Synergy server?
This is what happens when you leave your secondary computer running #newtwitter all weekend. 
@raster those are the questions from @usesthis; the content is c creative commons. Cool that flickr is using it.
@jclermont I'll be there and so will @ashedryden

@jclermont But we don't need more. The last thing I want is a buggy, non-standards-compliant mobile web browser deployed to a % of consumers

@jclermont they should just stop now while they're behind.
In 1999 it was cool to use a happy hacking keyboard on your Linux box. In 2010, you use Apple bluetooth keyboard with all your Apple devices
Chrome powerusers: is there a setting to make Chrome less enthusiastic at dragging a tab to a new window? Happena every time I click a tab.
@blissdev tweeting with curl again?
@Arlen ah. and it's not bluetooth? lame.
@Arlen Apparently I should have jumped on getting a happy hacking keyboard when they were only $75. They're $265 now.
@Arlen Maybe I'll get one of these on ebay: 
@Arlen lied how? Also, *never* shop at Milwaukee PC. Worse than shopping at Best Buy, imho. Bunch of high school kids, terrible cust serv.
@Arlen interesting. I type on chiclet keyboards all day, but not if you mean the cellphone gummy-click keys.
I'm falling asleep. That Jolt doesn't work anymore.
@Arlen I would try the MS Arc if it were BT & was free ;) 
@Arlen what do you recommend? I've been most happy with the wired apple keyboards but feel like I'm missing out on even better keyboards.
@Arlen I'd like to try one of these for a few hours: 
@Arlen Wow, "only" $500!
@Arlen I've gone back to the ZX Spectrum keyboard for precisely that reason:  (I keed.)
Lunch is Jolt cola and corn chips. Still shooting for that heart attack before 25!
New drupal.org keeps making me do a double-take. It looks nice, yes, but it keeps tripping up my "this is a spam/scam site!" filter as well.
@aaronsaray V8 is good stuff, and there is never enough in the bottle. Especially spicy V8.
@jclermont Interesting difference between the apps that Apple shows off for the iPhone versus Microsoft showing off a /Kraft Food app/

I'm at Boston Massacre Site in Boston, MA 
Good coffer is required. Accidentally bought super-crappy drop coffee because I assumed everything isgood like alterra.
I'm at Government Center MBTA in Boston, MA 
Now: to find the aquarium!
I give props to museum exhibit designers. Kids are rough on them.
Gold star if you can name all the computers 
Seeing a lightning show on the world's largest van de graff generator.
This just in: hundreds of kidson field trips, trying to destroy the exhibits at the science museum. I fear for america's future.
I'm at Boston Museum of Science 
The problem with yelp: if you search for "vegan breakfast" it matches the reviews that says "they don't do breakfast & have nothing vegan."
Charger didn't charge my phone last night. Usually not a  problem because I sit next to a USB port of some sort all day. #firstworldproblems
I'm at Copp's Hill Burying Ground in Boston, MA 
I'm at Old North Church 
I'm at Paul Revere's House in Boston, MA 
@GregTracy recommendations would be great. Thanks in advance :D
@GregTracy right now or for dinner or?
I'm at King's Chapel Burying Ground in Boston, MA 
I'm at Kings Chapel in Boston, MA 
Had to get one more dunkin donuts coffee before I left! — at Dunkin Donuts - Terminal C 
Back at the airport. Time to go home. — at Terminal C at Logan International 
Standing in a line. I think I wore a hole in my foot on this trip with all the walking.
I'm at New England Aquarium in Boston, MA 
I'm at MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, MA 
I'm at MIT Museum in Cambridge, MA 
@AliSwoop we were there yesterday morning. We loved it :)
I'm at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA 
Boson seems like another continent from Milwaukee. Maybe it is due to the flight instead of driving. Can't imagine a flight to Europe.
@antifuchs we will try to go. Depends on how long the MIT Museum takes. We are planning to go to the aquarium yet & our plane leaves at 6pm.
Coffee (that isn't dunkin donuts) & tofu fajitas for breakfast. So necessary before we head — at Blue Shirt Cafe 
cc: @Meor @addictedimage I don't know who you guys are, but I think you should go to couples therapy and stop CCing me on tweets :P
@ashedryden I really want an i7 macbook air. Steve Jobs let me down
Puking: it's not just for models anymore.
Apple store guy just said that 11" macbook air is "the netbook version of the macbook" Someone is getting so fired when Steve Jobs finds out
@tomhenrich we're probably headed to bayshore. Sorry.
Poor @ashedryden is a cripple from all the walking we did in Boston.
Thinking about installing Ubuntu on my netbook with nothing but Racket/dr. Racket installed as the window manger. I'll call it littleschemer
@darrickhartman I've had Samsungs & they're durable, but the Dell ST2410 I've already got is so clear and great-looking. It was refurb, too.
Although sub in a Dell st2410 24" display and I'm about $819 closer to that dream.
Thinking 2.13Ghz 4GB Macbook air and a 27" Apple cinema display. A man can dream.
Somerville in Boston has a little breakfast cafe that is veg/vegan friendly. I've decided 5th Ward needs one, ideally next to @Bucketworks.
@ashedryden oh, you should run PHP Gallery, like I did in 2003-era.
@nikulr Didn't realize I wasn't following you until right now. My follows/unfollows were, for a time, managed by a script. Sorry.
@corbenfrost @3liza Also, this turned up with some random googling: 
@corbenfrost The second link is a screencap of Swordfish. I couldn't find any good screencaps of his computer setup w/ a font visible.
Dear @twitter: Why can't I search my followers or people I follow? The autocomplete isn't doing what I need. @hackweek maybe?
@tomgiles thanks. I'll try to txt my inside connection at Mayfair to see when they'll get them in.
@corbenfrost I was thinking something like Impact based on what movies show me:  
Thinking today is a good day to try out the Macbook Air. MKE folks: Which is more busy: Bayshore Apple or Mayfair Apple stores?
Please tell me where I DL'ed "“Code Switching” in Sociocultural Linguistics" & how I'm expected to read it on Sunday after 1 cup of coffee.
@3liza Now I've gone down the rabbit hole of finding another good programming/terminal window font. They're never good enough.
@3liza @corbenfrost Helvetica is a form of kung fu, many use it with mediocre skill & some are amazing at it. Trajan is a Roman broadsword.
@svdodge That's how my Jekyll-powered blog worked, except for a create-static-pages step. Github Pages does the same 
I'm not reading any work-related or twitter/fb/meetup email until Monday morning. I learned as much from @hotdogsladies; I have priorities.
@antifuchs @SpecGram @trochee What should that be called? SpecGram's Law of Inductive Halting?
Got "I &lt;3 APIs" stickers from @apigee. Love it, the @apigee guys are great :D
@auzigog can we get drupal 7 out for the election? That'd be a cool coincidence.
@Strabd Linode is great so far. We use Slicehost at work and it is great, as well.
So exhausted.
So glad to be back in Milwaukee: land of good food, good music, good beer and awesome, friendly people.
@ashedryden wants me to start flying her places on my private jet and rent out whole museums so errr don't have to deal with people.
Just landed in milwaukee
@abraham otherwise, it is faster than my desktop (1.8ghz macmini) as light as my netbook, and far sexier than anything I've used lately.
@abraham I'm with you on that. I just wish it could drive dual monitors and had an i7 w/ 8Gb or 16Gb RAM max. A man can dream..
@abraham 11" or 13"?
Need to code code code. Only I'm not in the brainspace to do that.
@DDysart did the house at least smell a little awesome before it died?
@ashedryden Considerations: Same screen resolution; SSD and RAM now make more of a difference than CPU speeds.  But the i7 is very powerful.
Also, where's my laptop with dual monitor out? Twinhead laptops did that IN THE 90'S.
HD television was the worst thing that happened to computer monitors.
@addictedimage haha, no worries. I was just like "who's telling me to go fuck myself?!"
Damn you Chile and New Zealand, why haven't you sent new fruit yet?
Unfortunately kids now may only know mega-, giga- & tera- where the smaller prefixes are more useful. I've never heard anyone say gigameters
Kids in the USA didn't learn metric prefixes in the past from distances, weights and volumes, but they'll know them from their computers.
@drnautilus we went to the new england aquarium in boston; here's some pictures: 
@cthielen I read it was mSATA connection but the form factor is no longer that of a hard drive.
@compujeramey This might be a year or more out.
@aaronsaray @ashedryden By my thinking, we'd need a huge sign-up list to get it to work. 60-100 people committing to it is going to be hard.
I'm going to a Meetup with Milwaukee PHP Users Group! 
What does everyone think about a 48hr startup launching event (like startup weekend) at @Bucketworks, + a few speakers & catered food?
Need to grind coffee, but don't want to wake @ashedryden.
Anyone know how to code a "Most Popular Posts" sidebar block in @posterous? A "recent posts" block would work, even.
@svdodge they switch based on wind direction, it seems. They seemed to start that after the Blue Angels were practicing in MKE last year.
My knuckle tattoos will say "HACK" and "CODE"
@phillijw Also: I was too tired to notice the "might be the same in git" at the end of your tweet. heh.
@phillijw This is git. I think I forgot to commit/push the .gitignore changes on my desktop at home, and we're working remotely.
I seem to have committed some code or a config file that broke the database connection. only I gitignored all the conf/db stuff.. lame.
@svdodge @raster yeah but twitter background services (colourlovers) never worked for me, so they must never work, and therefore be useless.
Some guys just walked into this George Webb discussing DnD or WoW or something. NERDs. I may try to go talk to them but my charisma is low.
@blissdev & I are discussing prototyping web apps. My issue is there's no way to "sketch" & you want to turn it into a real thing eventually
@sfradkin unfortunately don't have a hardware policy in place at work, everyone uses their own machine.
@abraham @ashedryden and I've been working on a hackintosh netbook for months, don't forget
@abraham @ashedryden I used to code on white non-unibody macbook & that was more than adequate. SSD & extra screen res on Air will be good.
@sfradkin Paying for a tool to do my job; like a carpenter investing in his tools. It's a priority because I'm losing money if I can't work.
@sfradkin And of course, that's neglecting the fact that a $400 PC laptop will never compare to the performance of a MBP. $700-$900 maybe.
@sfradkin My 12" Powerbook is still alive and kicking, just not powerful enough for what I do. It was built in 2005 and cost around $1800.
@sfradkin This is the way I see it: buy a $400 laptop every 2 years or buy a $1800 machine once.
@sfradkin I'd use Ubuntu as a primary OS if it didn't tempt me to tweak it for 15 hours a day. The bonus of Mac OS X is that it Just Works.
@sfradkin Show me a hackintosh that has full hardware support, durability (aluminum),  battery life and is as powerful as a MBP for cheaper.
@np7776 Because I'm poor and can only afford one laptop
Hanging out with @blissdev.
Damnit swype.
@AJBombers @philgerb That was the most amazing thing i've ever seen on the internet: twitter burger orders.
@np7776 2.8ghz i7 mbp w/glossy high res. I'll max out the RAM and add an SSD later.
@ashedryden No, bouncing bus icons would make it more awesome. But it would remain just as useful. @GregTracy
While I approach new laptop-itude, the rest of my computer hardware is falling to the effects of entropy. That means today I have no mouse.
Today is probably new laptop day for me.
@GregTracy We used Boston BusMap on my Droid in Boston. It was neat, but @ashedryden wished that animated the buses bouncing down the street
Boston was awesome. Can't shake the feeling that Milwaukee is headed in the same direction, we're just lacking 200 years of extra history.
The story is that Steve Jobs got stopped in Japan for carrying ninja stars. The truth is that he was carrying a Macbook Air prototype.
@sfradkin Last I checked, Wisconsin doesn't grow kiwis. #itryreallyhardbutsometimesihavecravingsforthingsthatarentlocal.
Mini Cooper (a real one) on 94 in Milwaukee. 
@nikulr @OldManKris that's the thing that scares me.. I don't want to be in debt to a credit card company for any amount of time.
@jclermont I have no issue with WinMo7 I'm just partial to Android and stuck to Verizon for 2 years & would rather not pay for a new phone.
@nikulr yes
@nikulr totally. it just gives me a little more breathing room and the 2.8Ghz processor :D
@nikulr worth it? any gotchas?
Has anyone done the barclaycard Visa at the Apple Store when buying a new mac? to pay off the mac in a few months?(or at least in 12 months)
Just pointed out that the men who work at @Bucketworks have been preparing for Novembeard with Octobeard: grow 8 beards in October.
@abraham Interesting, KBSSL does http before https according to that, which is still insecure. I may just go back to FF for netbook browsing
laag
Oh please make "Young Turks" by Rod Stewart stop being playing in my head.
@abraham what's the best Chrome extension to force SSL?
@blissdev Gingerbread = 2.3, there's also a 3.0 in the works that is rumored to be optimized for tablets.
@blissdev It isn't really news on Android, just the codename: 
Trying Brain Toniq (a caffeine-free "think drink") so far.. it just tastes weird. no effect noticed.
@mjburian Same here. I never make phone calls.
@blissdev @jclermont Sorry, but that was @Kevron using my computer while I was away. I'm much more excited about Android Gingerbread!
Someone tweeted as me. Who's running FireSheep at @bucketworks?
Those new WinMo 7 phones look hot #lust #want
Lunch with  — at Honeypie Cafe 
@rohdesign 15" with high-res screen sits right in the middle. In the apple store, I couldn't type on the 17"; the palmrest is huuge.
Recommendations for server monitoring tools other than MRTG?
Just estimated out my taxes that will be due for contracting/consulting this year. It's not new laptop day :(
@rohdesign I've done a lot of thinking & played with the new Macbook Air. I like it, but the 2.13Ghz MBA &lt; 2.66Ghz i7 MBP in performance/$.
@np7776 Although I have yet to look at my budget for the next couple months. Maybe I won't go top-of-the-line.
@ashedryden @GregTracy I wish Milwaukee had some sort of API we could scrape.
@ashedryden writing your blog post about @hotdogsladies' Madison talk?
@corbenfrost Indeed.
#lazyweb Low-resources launcher ala Quicksilver for OSX? I only want it to launch apps, not search. Has to run fast on my hackintosh netbook
@corbenfrost The "I'm busy" excuse doesn't apply here, I realize. It just takes it being painful to remind me to do PT exercises.
@corbenfrost but we probably walked 15 miles each day, plus time standing and on public transit. Compared to sitting at a desk all day.
@corbenfrost I guess I need to get a padded strap and keep my busted shoulder in shape. I was worn out carrying a bag in Boston for the wknd
Remind me never to read comments on sites like Engadget ever again.
Is anyone planning to use free Amazon ec2 Micro instances as a SheepSafe SSH tunnel box?
@corbenfrost maybe point to point. Try a weeklong trip walking everywhere w/bag, 15" MBP, accessories/charger, as well as carryon of clothes
RT @ppinheiro76: MacBook Air 11.6" vs PowerBook 12" G4    
On the Macbook Air: 'the best computer is the one that you have with you, not the one sitting on your desk back home' 
I want a pet monkey but @ashedryden won't let me have one. She has 3 cats; it isn't fair!
OH: Damn it, don't you know how much bandwidth monkeys take up?!
@tomhenrich sorry. this is veggieland.
@tomhenrich I've got a cupcake from Comet Cafe here for you. Just come pick it up and it is yours.
@gruber are you going to buy a Macbook Air?
@blissdev Yes, yes they are.
@blissdev Intel's SSD drive controllers are supposed to be a lot faster than everything else, including the Crucial. Apparently matters most
@blissdev your machine is gonna be a screamer!
@thebestsophist I'm disappointed daily by my brain, as well. I'm second in line for a refund.
@zacwitte that is beautiful.
Not a great day for @mathiasx
I just gained @ashedryden's undying love and then grossed her out enough that she had to leave the room.
@jclermont @aaronsaray Sorry I didn't make it out to @MKEPUG. Feeling really sick tonight and still exhausted.
@hotdogsladies Thank you. Since your Madison talk, when people are communicating online, I imagine them in the "Are you priotizing?!" voice.
RT @plural: I spent my day building robots for a sumo wrestling tournament at work. Then I took a nap.  Awe. Some.
They're using some sort of machinery across the street that is humming at a frequency that my headphones can't tune out.
@cjibo I am suggesting that the @bucketb standardize on this for all our computers.
@rralian Greg also knows/uses Twilio more than anyone else I know.
@ralphholzmann I made it kinda weak, I realized. The next pot will be much stronger.
I follow way too many people to keep up with, so I've decided that you all will have to fight to the death.
@jclermont There's a couple SCSI Jazz drives in a bin of scrap PC parts here at @Bucketworks.
I think I need a "remote office day" out in the woods. Without all this wind, though.
@jclermont I prefer Laserdisc
@jclermont Real Zip disk flaw, but you can tell them that whether it has click-of-death or not to get them to stop using it.
@jclermont Tell them it has the click-of-death, which is a physical flaw that destroys drives & diskettes; their Zip drive is not to be used
@cthielen It was nice knowing you.
I should note that the orange text was added in Skitch and saved as the background image, because I have no photoshop.
This has been my netbook's background image for awhile. I think it is funny. 
@matthusby I make deliveries, too.
RT @xenijardin: I'm going as "Sexy SQL database" this Halloween.
@bucketworks Just started a fresh pot of coffee. @megcicc @matthusby etc
@rralian You should talk to @GregTracy
Debating a walk to Foundry Alterra to get more coffee for the office. This lack of caffeine is killing me.
@mathiasx that is, I meant *expensive*. $80/yr divided by my avg purchases per year (appears to be 15 orders of 2 items) = $5 S&H per order.
Ugh. Pepsi Max is terrible (must be the aspartame) but we're out of coffee in the office and are subsisting on leftover soda from #bcmke5
@cori free fast shipping should be a human right, though. like air.
Amazon Prime free trial ended and it autorenewed itself for a year. Extensive, but worth it.
Finally got around to ordering @Rands 's Being Geek.
@TheLarch realized I don't have my bike lock here so I won't make it. Sorry.
@blissdev I have not found the time/energy and it is bumming me out.
Wishing I'd worn wool today.
@JYoda For hosting Ruby webapps, you should look at @heroku  similar but not exactly like Google Appengine
@JYoda    
@JYoda The Sinatra book is a good intro:  although it might assume too much knowledge of ruby.
@TheLarch I might be able to bike up, but in this wind I can't predict how long after 12 I'd be there.
@SaraSantiago congrats on 13K tweets btw :D
@JYoda Ruby will feel like squeaky-clean Perl and Sinatra is a domain specific language for creating RESTful web apps.
@JYoda Ruby and Sinatra would be my recommendation.
@SaraSantiago If you haven't seen it: 
me: "She looks orange." @kevron: "She is orange. and proud." Talking about The Jersey Shore, which I've never heard of before.
@rohdesign I second the @RishiTea recommendation. @ashedryden.
@rohdesign Adagio has a good intro, I think: 
@joshjs There's one on KK too.
@rohdesign That's so terrible.
@abraham That sucks :(
@AJBombers We have been saying that we need a new breakfast place.
@abraham Things you can't do with a Macbook Air.
@ralphholzmann Every day lately, for me.
so there's a 1Tb torrent of all the stuff that was on Geocities: 
I'm at Comet Cafe in Milwaukee, WI 
Dear Synergy: please stop tweeting my password when I type it into my main computer and hit enter.
Get Excited and Make Things @Bucketworks !
@tapps BLOCKED.
I think I spent more time getting Harvest set up again to track time on a project than I did on client work. But I forgot how to #myfault
@ashedryden bought greek magnetic poetry at MIT 
OH: "an onion of sexiness."
@matthusby 
@tomhenrich See the second option, excluding tags?
@tomhenrich You need Textmate. Convert to HTML Entities is builtin functionality. 
It took 2 days for @bucketb and @groupcard to drink a pound of coffee. Woot. World champions!
@rohdesign zip it!
Why is there no reply button?!
@tomhenrich Yes. Movie night? Too bad it's too cold to do an outdoor projector night.
@tomhenrich It has been too long since I last saw The Matrix.
It's all fun and games until someone loses an iphone.
@nikulr 
@nikulr hook up your acoustic coupler and start decoding.
If you watched me all day, you'd think 99% of my job is typing on a computer and 1% is making more coffee. And that's all you'd think I do.
@svdodge I'd be curious to see if they got any of my stuff, too.
@jennaddenda in Scott Pilgrim, the psi-vegan says something like "I do not eat of the flesh nor drink of the milk of my animal brethen."
Free burritos for @ashedryden, @kevron and me. Sorry, not for anyone else; we returned some gear to Qdoba.
@svdodge I don't have a spare 1Tb disk to put it on
@antifuchs Thanks for the recommendation. giving it a try :D
@AJBombers I'll even come teach some vegetarian/vegan breakfast recipes that are tasty :)
@AJBombers can I get my "foot in the door" early by requesting a good selection of veggie/tofu options? :)
Ok, so my bluetooth mouse is dead, and I can't click the "Add a mouse" button in System Preferences.app to add a different bluetooth mouse.
@ashedryden wants to replace @tafferinspace's hypothetical missing eye with a laser that he would chase all day.
Me: Are you tweeting about me on The Facebooks? @ashedryden: You can't tweet on Facebook. Nice try though.
@ashedryden is going to read Being Geek before I get a chance to. Cc: @joshjs
@alanwilliams I drink my own pound of coffee every week at home, and I'm only home long enough to have 1 pot or so in the morning.
@ashedryden bought magnetic poetry at MIT 
I can't even imagine how powerful this laptop is. My fastest computer so far has been a 1.8Ghz macmini with no graphics card to speak of.
Just ordered the 15" 2.8Ghz i7 Macbook Pro w/ high-res display. Excited, to say the least.
@phillijw I already eat burritos all the time. What else?
@samwisethegreat so sorry.
Programmers: what one thing made you better at what you do?
And I just accidentally sat on the black cat in the dark.
For the first time in a long time, my shoulder hurts.
Neighbors are loud and drunk and playing crunk music. It's pissing us off.
@phillijw billian?
RT @trodrigues: why oh why did I leave home today
@sintaks that one is equally funny.
OH: I love looking crotches.
Awesome morning. Caffeinated.
@plural that will be or next book. Looks so awesome!
I need a device that tweets whatever I say, all the time.
RT @Novembeard: Today is the day... the day to SHAVE! #Novembeard begins tomorrow.
@cheshster It can. Can you magically make less work for me to so that I have time to play any game?
@cthielen SSD is definitely on the must-have list. Just didn't have the cash on hand to get what I want.
Found an article on implementing HTTPS in Rails 3 by sticking nginx in front & doing a reverse-proxy. Anyone know of a Rack-based solution?
@ashedryden: "why is my iphone so slow?" Me: "Because it is an  iphone." &gt;:)
@cthielen @geofflane I will get 8 gigs of RAM & a big SSD (probably with the drivebay kit) eventually. From Apple those are both overpriced.
New Apple lap top yay! 
I guess no one wants to congratulate me on my new laptop.. because they're all jealous.
Instead of being productive, I got sidetracked today creating  stuff like  Note: not a vim editor for .NET
Fleshing out my list of must-haves with additional apps from my hackintosh netbook.
Funny thing: I've got more apps installed on my hackintosh netbook than on my macmini. But the netbook has been my workhorse at work.
@matthusby @abraham @KeVroN Thanks for recommendations.
@joshjs @jeffmke agree.
I think I may give Kaleidoscope.app and Changes.app chance. Maybe Things.app, too. Just not a fan of paying for what I can already do free.
@KeVroN Not a fan of Perian, Flip4Mac, etc. I'd rather just stick with VLC. Also, yours is based on an older version of my list ;)
I can add to my list of required apps  which is the most powerful Git client for Mac. They just came out of stealth mode
He's a Borg from Star Trek for Halloween: 
Oh, and railstutorial.org teaches Github & Heroku from the beginning as well. It should get interested folks on their way to pro RoR work.
Railstutorial.org is really good so far. Teaches more than just Ruby on Rails: there's also git and TDD throughout.
No other recommendations for Mac software I should install on a new machine?  #lazyweb
@svdodge probably better for you, yeah.
@svdodge Sounds like it needs an SSD :D
@svdodge How is your MBP holding up?
@svdodge yeah but... Not a netbook or a macbook air ;) My 12" powerbook weighed as much but was about the size of the 11" MBA, squared off.
#lazyweb: Required Mac apps? I'm trying to see if there is anything I missed: 
Worried that the 15" MBP is too big. I was holding @ashedryden's for her & it nearly crushed me. Plus it doesn't really sit on your /lap/
@StdyHll see you there. Also, you might want to update the red banner at the top of your site from First meetup is October 21st! to schedule
@hacketyhack you are my hero.
Naming things is the hardest part.
@ashedryden just introduced me to this:  and now I'm obsessed with it.
@KeVroN Yes, we looked before we left for it.
The one day we wanted to go to the Milwaukee Re:Store, they're not open.
Pretty sue that running RescueTime.app is making me so neurotic about productivity that I'm just reading twitter and g reader on my phone.
@bitfyre How is this different than just using rvm on its own? I'm interested, just trying to figure it out.
I'm going to a Meetup with RubyMKE! 
@jclermont good luck with the MBA. I wanted one (12" powerbook was my main machine for 5years) but I got a MBP so it is still useful in 5yrs
@jclermont did you get the 13" macbook air or the 11"?
@nikulr I meant "I should have ordered it"
Anyone interested in buying my hackintosh dell mini9 netbook? Has maxed out RAM and a 32gig SSD. Just testing the waters; make me an offer.
@nikulr Saturday night yeah. I would've just ordered it while I was at the apple store
#lazyweb What's the best sleeve for a 15" Macbook Pro? I want drop protection and possibly waterproofness.
Dear Apple: please ship my laptop. I need it. Thanks! Your pal, @mathiasx
@nikulr I didn't shave yesterday, so I'm disqualified. I need to buy new blades for my shaver.
@nikulr I've been telling people, if they time it right, they can do both #Novembeard and #Movember.
@gregtarnoff it could be a twilio # doing transcription added to skype conf call.But it wouldn't be smart enough to distinguish each speaker
Can't wait until something like youtube's auto-captioning, feature is included in skype so we get meeting transcripts on the fly.
@blissdev congrats! hope you get everything working!
I used to be able too stay up all night studying, but not anymore. Good night, folks.
Our cats smell like cigarette smoke. They probably think they're so cool. Time to go ground them.
Stupid egg-stealing pigs.
@svdodge I don't think the unibody drivebay kit will work in your MBP or else you could fit two 500 gig drives in there.
@blissdev loctite blue that is. designed so that you can unscrew the fastener later, does not require heat for removal.
@blissdev could you use loctite or a rolled up piece of soda can to replace the stripped material?
The 13" Macbook Air got better in its 3rd generation, so by the 3rd rev of the 11" Macbook Air we should have a killer little laptop.
@raster this just made my day: 
@blissdev so you couldn't install the HDD in place of the optical drive?
I think I'll use doubletwist as a podcatcher for my phone on my new macbook pro.
@plural awesome!
The neighbors are loud and I forgot to bring home my big DJ headphones to drown out the neighbor's surround sound.
@thebestsophist have you tried tofu.app? Not technically an ebook  reader.
@jclermont Finally got dropbox sorted. here's my version  with minimal editing. just dragged into place & it lined up.
Coding in vim is significantly slowed down when the cat wants to  sleep on your Escape key.
What I thought was a dead pixel on my Droid X is probably just dust under the glass. That doesn't make it any less annoying, though.
9 minutes.  That's how long it took before we turned off The Net 2.0
The Net 2.0 is on hulu. @ashedryden & I haven't seen it, but we know it is going to be bad. Timing how long before we decide to turn it off.
418 I'm a teapot.
@blissdev twitter bug, it seems.
@blissdev twitter claims you unfollowed me so I  can't reply to your DM.
@tomhenrich Suggestions?
@whil I need to go out for a ride tonight, too.
@gwenix there is already a git shell or three, so I won't make mt own, but I right the change wad rather clever.
If I were going to make a git shell, I'd call it Ghost in the Shell (gits)
I am going to make a @twilio service that just plays hold music when you call in. Want to collaborate, @GregTracy? :D
new macbook pro is a screamer, so it got a hostname that suits it:  banshee.
#lazyweb recommend me Mac screensavers that are beautiful and music to work to.
@svdodge Get skitch. Auto saves and 1 click to upload. Droplr screenshots and uploads in one click but you don't get a local copy.
@svdodge I don't let anything go on my desktop
I like this MBP a lot.
It's here! 
My allergies are bad and we're all out of benedryl. Going to be a long, miserable day

@thebestsophist If I come across a script to convert epubs to PDF, I'll let you know. I use chm2pdf to convert Windows Compiled Help File.
@jclermont I said yesterday that I want this speed and capacity in a solid state macbook air form factor.
@matthusby the advantage is that you can RMA it. Thanks for link, tho.
@matthusby The dell outlet usually has  23" ST2310 for $150. @ashedryden has one in her office, & we both have the 24" version at home.
@apigee thought I'd share my new laptop. Your sticker is the only one it is getting 
New MBP is actually fast enough to make Quicksilver respond to my searches almost instantly. Can't imagine this with an SSD.
@Strabd Thanks, that'll work.
I want to hide everything underneath my desk with mounts like this:  and put the monitor on an Ergotron arm. #minimalist
@raster That's beautiful. Also, my shirt for next year is going to use the friend data from the #bcmke5 site to show a social network graph.

@matthusby @blissdev it's pretty amazing to see this installing rvm (essentially a huge, single thread Ruby process) and having 80% idle CPU
@matthusby it's a big step up from an atom-powered netbook :-)
@matthusby the fastest 15" MBP: 2.8Ghz i7. High-res screen. Waiting to upgrade the RAM and get an SSD.
@blissdev seems like it does.
@blissdev Yeah. Nice to have, just have to figure out where it is "configuring [stuff] to automatically start on login"
@blissdev That is, not sure I'll need mongodb, postgres, and memcache running all the time.
@blissdev I downloaded the tarball instead of using curl shortcut. I just need to figure out how to turn off some of the stuff it is running
Installing Cinderella  to get rvm and other fun stuff. Thanks for the recommendation, @jclermont & @blissdev!
Drooling over my new Macbook Pro, a day in. Yeah, it's that good.
Installed Doubletwist on my new MBP so that I could use it as a podcatcher for my Droid X.. only it doesn't do podcast subscriptions. Lame.
@jclermont that's what I need.
Android twitter client got updated with pull to refresh (which doesn't push the content down enough to avoid gradient) and crappy icons :/
Damn you, Marjorie, damn you straight to hell. (only fans of A Bit of Fry and Laurie will get this)
@raster this is the official client. It's definitely worse now.
Twidroid does not impress me so far.
@cheshster I really didn't like the winamp-skinned look of touiteur but I guess features are more important than looks.
@darrickhartman thank you. I'll have too get used to tweetdeck but it looks like a solution
@pxlate address book.app contacts? No idea, my gmail contacts are far more authoritive.
@pxlate Android is a nice platform. I'd recommend gmail contacts and maybe bring in his twitter & facebook contact data through those apps.
@pxlate oh, go into address book.app, preferences, then check synchronize with Google.
@pxlate For some reason I assumed everyone sets this up on OSX, but I imagine it's not that widely used. I don't use Address Book personally
rake db:migrate is so fast now! I always thought I was waiting for the computer to do really-hard-stuff.
@ReidDave I'm just on a modern computer now. (my new macbook pro)

I just told @ashedryden and @blissdev I'm going to 'antique' my Macbook Pro with some stainless steel.
Anyone know of a Mac app for organizing eBooks & PDFs? (Genre,read/unread,etc) Academics must use something with all the articles they read.
I think I found the answer to my question:  but it is $42 and I was thinking free :-)
@SaraSantiago I concur. I'm not a doctor, but I read about one once on WebMD.
I'm looking for something that does for ebooks (ePub, pdf, html) what iTunes does for music folder mgmt, and also figuring out the metadata.
@gregtarnoff do you know vim? MacVim.app is free, fast, and stable. I can point you in the direction of plugins to grab, too.
@gregtarnoff vim is a modal editor, MacVim adds on the GUI components, but there's still a learning curve if you don't know vim, imho.
I have 12 gigabytes of books. I was thinking I could sync them in Dropbox, but not with the free 2gig plan..
"What's the use of twitter if they don't tell me the answers to all my questions?" -- me :P
Have tried Calibre (despite being a swiss army knife, has crappy design), iPapers.app, Yep.app, Papers.app (these 3 cost $ after free trial)
@Tmtx Thanks :)
@corbenfrost Stanza is mobile software, not desktop software?
Tried Books.app, but it mostly for physical book library management (ala Delicious Library) it doesn't allow PDFs/ePubs to be imported.
@alanwilliams You're right. I just wasn't thinking to use it. I will give it a try.. importing 12 gigs of books now :-)
@alanwilliams It only seems to respect the filename, doesn't pull in metadata. Which means I can't search by genre, author, etc.
@corbenfrost  -&gt; "Page not found." Everything points to an iTunes app store link for Stanza for iOS.
@alexfalkenberg the book reader built into it was clunky/ugly and wouldn't even advance a page.
@jclermont Yes, that was @ashedryden's suggestion. I told her GUI Mac apps aren't a weekend project ;)
Yep (yepthat.com) is the clear winner after lots of research. In 10 days the free trial will expire and I'll decide whether it is worth $40.
It's been confirmed by a panel of psychiatrists: @ashedryden is addicted to Shaun the Sheep.
Watching the Objectified documentary with @ashedryden. Kind of wish that I wasn't pushing bits, but writing code that pushes atoms around.
@ashedryden I'm pretty sure his wife would not be happy about that.
@raster pics or it didn't happen.
@smutandeggs #newtwitter uses something called 'local storage' for the tweets you've already seen, so that ir doesn't have to ask the server
@smutandeggs so until that local storage expires out you clear local data from your browser, tweets you've seen will still appear.
#novembeard day #6.. I keed. I've had a beard since we went to Boston.  
@pxlate Try Yep.app: It's not free; but it may be useful for you. I kinda wish it stored Author and other metadata for searching/filtering.
Filing bug reports for apps feels good, but I feel like I'm insulting the product. I always add the "Don't worry, I love your app!" line.
I finally went on youtube & watched "the rent is too damn high" & "Christine O'Donnell is a witch". Have I been busy? You could say that.
I've been getting 7 hours out of a charge on my i7 macbook pro. Not bad at all!

Becoming one of the monks from @doctorow's The Things that Make Me Weak & Strange: I track with RescueTime; mysleepbot now, wakemate someday
Also, I use Runkeeper on my Android phone to track cycling/walking.. but I haven't been out to exercise in awhile.
For those that haven't read it, @doctorow's The Things that Make Me Weak and Strange Get Engineered Away: 
I use this to track my open source commits on Github: 
@ckittel Someone registered my username and no one I know is on ohloh. All of my development and open source contributions occur on Github.
@ckittel I'm really just using the Calendar About Nothing for personal metrics visualization: whether I've contributed back recently or not.
@ckittel i don't really see how to hook ohloh up to anything else. I don't need yet-another-micromessaging/blogging engine :P
@ckittel The Journal was featured in the intro video as such, but no integration for other things, unless I create yet-another-project-page?
@ckittel I couldn't figure Ohloh out after reading 5 pages & watching screencast. Too much to get passive metrics. It's not obvious at all.
@ashedryden we live such a glamorous life.
Judging from my github commits between 2 and 3AM, I might be transitioning into a polyphasic sleep schedule.
@jacobroufa it wasn't intentional, I just woke up and was itching to work rather than fall back asleep.

@Ryan_Hilton I still stick to Textmate for editing, paired with a terminal, so I drop into vim when I can do things more efficiently in vim.
@Ryan_Hilton Start with vimtutor to cover commands. I recommend this as a start:  I use NERDTree, CommandT, and Pathogen
@Ryan_Hilton I put my .vim/ directory online:  but it really should be redone with git submodules to stay up to date.
@Ryan_Hilton The other nice thing is that vim is on every server I log into, so I can edit files right there without worrying about SFTP.
@Ryan_Hilton CommandT plugin for MacVim and turn on incremental searching, you'll get somewhat of Textmate's project searching prowess.
Railstutorial.org continues to be good. I'm only on chapter 3, because I have so little free time to devote to it. Learning Rails 3 is fun!
@abraham Donate to goodwill or a library? Just a thought.

Need a better way to mount power strips under my desk. This setup is just not working, for convenience or number of accessible outlets.
I should note, I'm already using an IKEA wire cable tray and hiding most of the power strips and power bricks in the Frederik desk crossbar.

Having a hard time getting Google Listen on Android to actually subscribe to podcasts, which is its intended functionality.
@plural That's been in my GReader to watch since you shared it last week or so. Just haven't had time. Maybe tonight!
Loud neighbors again.
@plural Can you recommend any monitors that have rotate-vertical built into the stand? I really want to get a nice extra monitor for coding.
@plural I may just spend the money to get an Ergotron Neo-flex arm though, and get a cheap 23" LCD.
@corbenfrost Maybe you should move here and our loud neighbors can move in next to your loud neighbors. Optimization!
@plural Our Dell ST2410's don't have fancy stands, and don't have any VESA mount. We were quite sad to find that out after buying them.
@plural Dell Outlet has one with a rotating stand (the G2410H) Looks like I've got something to save for ;)
I have found my tribe: 
@ashedryden I'm quitting all the negative influences in my life, and I'm starting with your fists.
@corbenfrost It tastes like licking a battery while chewing aluminum foil. It's genetic & not my fault that my genes give me superior senses

@ashedryden For whatever reason, can't find any config for zebra stripes. However, Textmate exists as a Mac we-know-whats-best-for-you app.
I can read 1 non-technical/coding book per week & I'd like to increase that. I can't make more time. Suggestions? No spdrding snake oil plz.
@colourlovers Favorited it :-)
@ashedryden just pointed out that a SF studio is $1500/month. That's a Macbook Air, or a PT worker. No wonder startups run out of money.
@tomhenrich @whil while helpful, that doesn't help my backlog of 1000+ page books I should read.
@tomhenrich @whil at least long books.

@gregtarnoff I need food+a bike ride, I think. I usually don't exercise before putting in another shift, but going to give it a try.

My Droid X has been rebooting after the web browser crashes. Now it is rebooting in my pocket. Uh, wtf?
@raster that's awesome. good luck. use heroku or appengine.
Has anyone thought about running the free ec2 micro instance as a git server? Not for huge codebases, obvs. Personal code backup would rock.

@littletinyfish Can't beat @planetbike for support and they're in Madison. Their lights are great too ;-)
@raster At @web414 I will introduce you to Ruby &  Imagine Ruby is very clean Perl where everything is an object ;)
@jclermont I'm thinking about doing a @web414 talk introducing Rails and Ruby in a very general way. What would you be interested in seeing?
@peregrine There's one coming up fast on Thursday, the 11th. See  for details. It's not far from MSOE, you should come! ;)
I got sick. That plan to put in a second shift of kicking ass and taking names is not gonna happen tonight :(
@chrisjaure git push?
Woke up an hour ago. Allergies and train-of-thought won't let fall back asleep. Frustrating.
Morning, world.
@raster I have a busy day ahead of me with meetings & lots of coding, but I will have a response to you sometime tonight or before @web414.
@pxlate It came up in some searching. The problem is, I want to have the author & genre pulled in from the ISBN or title & be able to search
@aaronsaray I will totally do a session on PHP at some point for @mkepug. Just need to figure out what people want to hear.
@jclermont A good book is very important in learning MVC. I feel that Agile Web Dev with Rails, while most commonly read, is not that good.
@aaronsaray I would love to do a talk on the differences between running a PHP app on LAMP stack to a Rails/Django application server stack.
@ralphholzmann the good news: time for an iPhone 4?
@aaronsaray Dec 14 is highly doable. I will make sure I put some time in my calendar to ensure I have a talk prepared & live examples & such
dear skype: I don't mood messages. You shouldn't be notifying me, because I turned that off. STOP. IT.
@jclermont I should point out that I'm more of a Sinatra tinkerer than I am a Rails expert. I roll my own MVC a lot. But it is very similar.
@ralphholzmann that's terrible :(

@raster .dotfiles can be committed in git and will show up on github. Noticed your .htaccess is named _htaccess ;)
@raster Also take a look at  and  -&gt;"Ignoring files" to use .gitignore;)
@plural have you found a way to have DrRacket/DrScheme output function expansion at each step? Ex: I did it manually in 
@dlouhy Did you ever release the blue DrRacket icon? Scrolled through your twitter stream to see but Twitter won't go back that far.
@raster do you have _htaccess set as the filename to look for in your Apache config? Also, I turned on show hidden files in Finder with Bash
@raster this post has a shell script to toggle it & an automater action 
@raster Or use my script  I cleaned up his quotes since Wordpress replaced them, and adding echos.
@plural I'm aware that later chapters implement a Scheme. I was thinking there's probably a way to do it by outputting the stack each call.
@raster No. Toggle it back off when you're done.
@raster Cake and eat it too.
Am I the only one who finds it funny that Youtube is asking you to connect with Facebook while GMail goes to war with them? 
@thebestsophist amazon wishlist & save for later not cutting it?
@blissdev It's not bad. Chip away at it slowly when you've got free time. No rush ;)
@ashedryden is knitting something cool. What is it? 
@thebestsophist My moleskines all fell apart at the binding. Maybe I'm hard on them, though.
I sincerely hope that the Tea Party idiots aren't the ones who get to rewrite our (revisionist) history. If so, the USA is doomed.
Was trying to find some resources for photowalking Milwaukee's history and found this awesome site: 
@thebestsophist It could probably be done with a coffee carafe, hotplate, thermocouple, Arduino & a copper coil for cooling w/ tap water.
@thebestsophist I used stickers and/or duct tape to repair bindings. Not as elegant as a well-weathered-yet-intact binding though.
@corbenfrost When the target is John McCain, it's fun *and* educational for the kids, too. @ashedryden
Trying to spend today learning and thinking. Not going so well. So many distractions on the internet..
I couldn't brain, so I'm settling in to watch a couple SICP lectures while @ashedryden naps.
Has anyone had experience with the Western Digital WD Elements external HDDs? I'm looking to get one, wondering what the failure rate is.
@trodrigues Reading a lot of reviews that they are dead in the first 6 months. Plus, WD uses their cheapest drives in them, not the best.
@jacobroufa What is it about the Samsung F-series that makes it better? Just curious; it's hard to pick the signal out of noise on reviews
@raster I had a Macally aluminum case  and it failed on me, taking the drive with it. Haven't bought from OWC since.
@raster Just threw my phone at our concret floor again by accident. Droid X status: still alive, undamaged.
@thebestsophist Yeah, I'm only backing up. My issue is that my backups are important to me & I don't want to backup redundantly ad infinitum
You can tell that I don't handle capiscum very often: avoided touching my eyes but somehow swiped my nose. Third degree burns in my sinuses.
Finally getting feeling back in my nose.
Here's some fun: (define (fib n)   (cond ((= n 0) 0)         ((= n 1) 1)         (else (+ (fib (- n 1))                  (fib (- n 2))))))

@lageekitude Interesting, especially running a business out of your home. Sadly, I doubt most are going to be aware until they run afoul.
@lageekitude I realize some laws are barriers to food venders,cabs,etc but I'm concerned about making it easier for web/tech startups in MKE
@lageekitude wow. that is really stupid.
My audio on my MBP isn't complying. Which pushed back this meeting. Which makes everyone cranky. Which makes me want to just duck out.
RT @rubymke: Don't forget #Rubymke tonight  @geofflane is talking NoSQL with MongoDB and ...
@lageekitude What's odd is that the Tavern League & landlords are big groups with power, and it's harder to squash them from what I've read.
@nikulr Trying to get the iphone headset mic to work in Skype. Tech specs say it should support the iphone headset, volume up/down works.
@nikulr through the headset mic and not the macbook's internal mic?
@nikulr Yep. @ashedryden just taught me how to do that. heh.
@nikulr Meeting over, so it isn't an issue anymore. Internal mic wasn't usable because of feedback & typing noise, so I just stayed on mute.
@nikulr Volume works, too. Mic in the headset doesn't.
OH: "I left the beeping on to remind me to check it again in a few minutes." &gt;.&lt;
@gregtarnoff I got spammed by Verizon themselves and a random spammer (make fat cash now!) today.
I figured I'd clean the sink before the maintenance got here to fix the Insinkerator. I accidentally fixed it before he got here. Awesome?
@DrCrypt any particular kind of hair conditioner? As an owner of a lot of wool, this is relevant to me.
RT @nzkoz: Yeah, I'm going to trust the home of zombie werewolf mafia farm wars to keep my inbox spam-free.
@Strabd I borrowed a scanner, put everything in Evernote, and shredded old documents that I was lugging around for that.
Dusk at 4:45pm =&gt; Feel exhausted by the end of the work day. Solution? Will probably buy redbull 4pk before @rubymke.
@tomhenrich 20oz can is cheaper yet.
@tomhenrich the problem is that redbull is not a sustainable solution. Doesn't solve the "my body is exhausted at 5pm" problem either.
@tomhenrich maybe if the goddamn sun would shine I could get a decent day's worth of day out of the day. #unnecessaryswearing
Just got a FWD from my family about a virus "confirmed by Norton and snopes.com" No virus name listed. Yeah, that's so awesome.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
Math for FWDing email. Assume you FWD it to 25 ppl, they FWD it to 25 more, etc and it takes 5 seconds. (25 * 5)! = OMG YOU KILLED A PERSON!
aka You've just now wasted more time than there is time in the universe.
Going for the award of speaking at every meetup and usergroup held at @Bucketworks in December. Hopefully I survive.
@geofflane We're having dinner still, not at @bucketworks. Did you try to ring the bell?
@geofflane be there in 5.
@geofflane Sorry about that. @rubymke.
@rubymke is starting now!
Does anyone have a link to the most actively developed branch of Notational Velocity with Markdown support? Github isn't showing the graph.
RT @bitfyre: @bucketworks for @rubymke and NoSQL with @mongodb and Ruby. #devmke  — at Bucketworks  
Impressed that @geofflane can steer a tangential conversation nicely back onto his slide ;)

@rohdesign really? I didn't know that Bill Gates was such a fan of The Monkees.
@tomhenrich That screams "I don't know how to configure Apache" so loudly.
If you got UTF8 problemsI feel bad feel you son, I got 99 problems but an umlaut ain't one.
I just gave 5 stars to a Meetup for RubyMKE 
Nice day outside. I'll have to sneak away to take a bike ride before it gets dark.
@tomhenrich freedom is evil avoiding to @raster. Out did he say that evil is freedom? Can't remember.
Following facebook's lead of tricking ignored users into thinking you friended them, Twitter will send "having lunch"tweets to blocked users
Redbull + candy: If I'm going to go into diabetic shock from the corn syrup, I'm going to do it right.
Pretty sure the @bucketb's weekday purchases of redbull, iced tea, & snacks from the convenience store is keeping that business afloat.
@svdodge @littletinyfish Getting a blowout in your livingroom is also up there in the perfect places category.
OH yesterday: "Hey look, a twitter client screenshot that doesn't have @marcusnelson in it!"
I'd say Girl Talk has improved Party in the USA by Miley Cyrus so much that she should just stop singing her version.
@mkedave Last fall a guy broke his chain in the rain on Water. No other cyclists around, I stop to help w/ tools and he gets angry at me! :P
@marcusnelson It's true. We live so cariously..
It upsets my engineer sensibilities that the pull to refresh icon on the android twitter app spins off center.
I need to do something about my beard. I'm turning into Teen Wolf.
Why isn't Network Solutions' page on SSL running over SSL? !?!
@raster I see @tomhenrich gets a mention and not me :(
@raster agreed. Where's my jetback?
@raster I think you'll be happy to hear about my  new project: the open source life.
@raster documentation will all be Creative Commons
@raster it will be up to each person to implement.
@raster the beauty of this protocol is  that it deprecates the "money" dependency for the life package.
Why I'm coding this: "On the other hand, it is not obvious how to design a better algorithm... and we leave this problem as a *challenge*."
@KeVroN yeah, Mozilla is mondo-evil. @raster
@RyTron you have mail robots? !!!
Please, please stop using the phrase "lawyered up." Especially in print.
Looking west over Walker's Point and Miller Park, finding this morning's fog against rooftops and bare trees beautiful.
Sad is the day when Youtube (non-HD, just regular rez) is too slow and stuttering on a 1.86Ghz Core 2 Duo. Flash is dead, long live Freedom.
@svdodge re:Bandwidth gauge: We'd never hit 10Mbps.
@blissdev awesome!
@netsolcares This QueryType has no template
Just hit 5 simultaneous tasks completed. 16oz Redbull is doing its job today.
@alexfalkenberg I remember a review of this saying the motion is rotational (it doesn't really walk) so you could glue anything on as a skid
@ashedryden @RachelK funny, the word vomit is what I said originally #trackingFlowOfInformationThroughTwitter.
Worn out jeans versus the exact same levis new that are replacing it: 
@chernowa How old is your iTunes library file?
@chernowa It sucks to lose tweaked id3 tags, playcount, notes, etc. but I like to start a fresh iTunes library every major release or so.
@gregtarnoff no, the worn out ones are in front, with the frayed edges. My old cellphone's outline is quite distinct on front right pocket.
@nikulr oh you could have spent 13 minutes every night on it for the past month (30 days). Same total, feels like much less ;)
@cogmag_kevin starts where?
@cogmag_kevin Once I sort out my winter bike, I'm in.
@trodrigues nice new twitter avatar :D
@gilesgoatboy 
Saw the Woz (via skype) at Marquette. @danvoell was on the panel. Awesome night!
@KeVroNsBeard whaaaaaaaaaa
@KeVroN @lageekitude I used to have both the txts to my phone and IM turned on. I miss the IMs, except I follow 10x as many people. #spammy!
@sdboyer git with it man, we've got important important rebases to do! no more of these subversion tweets from you!
Me: "Better." @ashedryden: "What? My music, or your brown color?" #whaat
New twitter: purple, like the 80's. but my lazer portrait background was too big to upload.
"How do you do that?" "The same way you do it on Google Wave."
@lukemke 6am exists? I thought it was something made up to scare kids, like the bogeyman.
Novembeard day 18: 
Should I shave my beard today? First @reply wins.
I suspect this link will be good to share with both your kids and grandparents:  #awesome
@aaronsaray we have a winner. no beard shaving today.
Murray has figured out that the laser comes from little plastic tower, but not that last its shining on his head. 
The web is really askew for me no matter what connection I'm on. I should run a traceroute too make sure I'm not getting routed thru China.

I'll be speaking at RubyMKE on December 20th on Rails 3. More info:

@travisgoodspeed Any chance you can make it to MKE Dev House on Dec 3rd?  We're working on projects for BCMKE 2011
@IsleUntoHimself direct drawdio link 
@ashedryden Drupies sleep with the Drupalers?
@abraham I can Amazon Prime you some if you get really desperate.
@svdodge That's one way to convert. If you can clear BMX wheels. Or were they 24" road wheels?
@smutandeggs For awhile the fixie trick people were running 26" wheels for their strength and thicker tires. @svdodge
@abraham awesome. congrats!
@SaraSantiago Just confirmed you are the only person tweeting about #DelBocaVista. Well, until this tweet goes through..
Trying to convince @ashedryden to go to Yoshkosh for dinner. Yes, it's a real place.
@TeecycleTim good to know that in the land of religious freedom, you aren't allowed to build a mosque. or anything that looks like a mosque.
For some reason I saw this and thought I should show @tomhenrich 
@plural yep. I'm the guy falling asleep at the bar.
@ashedryden has vetoed my beard. Shaving now.
I'm so good at #novembeard that I had to quit after only 19 days. ;)
Cheap razors suck :(
Restarting #novembeard right this now. 1.5 weeks or so to grow another beard!
@geofflane @narkalant the beard will return. Just with better management. My old beard was out of control & I wasn't trimming it correctly.
@joshjs your shared items in GReader are banned from my GReader until the food presented improves in healthy-ness.
These honeycrisp apples from Outpost are amazing. AMAZING.
Oh hey, I've written more than 12K tweets now. #celebration
@alexfalkenberg 
@margesmith56 which orchard does the sticker say it is from? Just curious.
@tomhenrich ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?!?
Ugg boots: neither a right nor a privilege.
@Strabd we can skype you in.
The guy at the next take sounds just like Michael Cera & he just brought up Scott Pilgrim. Weird. — at Roast 
@tomhenrich we're talking about Robocop right now actually.
@jclermont I totally agree!
@jclermont nice streak! I've been so busy :/
Just got reminded that I have multitouch gestures on this trackpad. Makes me feel like I'm casting spells with my fingers vs just key combos
Made kitchen sink soup. Had to convince @ashedryden that I used USDA Grade A sink.
New Arcade Fire video by Spike Jonze is amazing. 
@gilesgoatboy It was one of those "saw it and thought of you" things that came across my feedreader :P
Gatorage is the best drink.
@usesthis The fact that everyone was using a Macbook Pro and Chrome||Firefox||Safari has me asking new questions. Nothing to post yet though
I think my new pants shrunk. ARGH.
@svdodge planning to :)
@Strabd Levis, which are cold wash only now. Which I did. *shrugs*
Poor @ashedryden left her knitting bag in a restaurant and had to run back to get it. Hopefully it's still there..
When the going gets tough, the smart get out the VISE Grip.
Sun Is out! 
@raster I guess I could scrape the CC licensed books of scifi authors and markov chains it. I don't consider that writing though.
@Strabd 511's with elastin (or else I can't bike in them) Doubt I'll be washing them again until they "break in". Old pair fit very well.
@LovesickRobot just so you know: 
@LovesickRobot gah, sorry. that looked a lot less blurry and a lot more rightside-up on my phone.
@LovesickRobot We've been scouring the Goodwills for a couple months now, and hung about half our art tonight.
Just reminded @ashedryden what time it is. We've been in manic must-clean-and-do-house-work mode since dinnertime.
Hooray for random Android reboots! Go open source!
@jclermont and you can embed it into Rails 3 with Rack middle ware.
@ashedryden yeah, that's not annoying or anything.
I hereby rename the common shower to The Idea and Inspiration Machine.
At @stackedbar.
@whil not yet!
@raster In answer to your question: Notifo is proprietary & their server is not open source. Wouldn't it be hypocritical of you to use it?
This is pretty awesome: 
@Arlen have you been to the relax your back store at bayshore? It's with it even if you're not buying there; the salesmen are knowledge imho
@lageekitude Here's the blog I mentioned at lunch: 
@RachelK I'm headed to the store soon, as well.
I love Dropbox because it's so simple to backup and sync my files. I never have to think about it, it just works. 
@ashedryden I told you that building the internet with spit and string wouldn't be the best idea! #internetEngineering
Or little art gallery hallway: 
 - That is, our* hallway
Everyone, you can call @ashedryden Goldilocks from now on.
Still alive. That is, I just beat Portal for the first time. (I haven't had a computer that can play 3D games for about 5 years or so.)
arrrrr
Having strong coffee and waking  up from my post-thanksgiving hibernation.
@corbenfrost the first night watch movie was good, sort of like the Russian Matrix + Underworld.
@corbenfrost I haven't seen it dubbed, so I don't know how good the US version is. & A little confusing since I don't know Russian folklore.
My @Github stickers are here!
@thebestsophist That would explain a lot. Like how he can fly his doghouse.
@version2beta I love #fauxsquare!
Shopping for furniture is annoying. Why can't I just Google Sketchup something and have it made in my replicator?
@svdodge I'll see your lego furniture and raise you a fedex-box couch!
We just bought couches. Yes, plural: couches.
@darrickhartman yes
It's hard being vegan 
@sumares we night cookies tonight too!
@ashedryden The salesman gave you a funny look.
I estimate I'm roughly 20 hours behind on working on my talks for December meetups, combined. That's not a good sign. #workingOnThemNow
November has been busy for me, and cut into my open source committing time: 
@abraham there's a geek fight on youtube where a macbook air is used in such a manner. Mac vs Windows fight. Can't find it on my phone.
@raster everything on that site is the size of christmas ornaments not furniture. Maybe dollhouse furniture.
@raster still not a replicator ;)
@raster yes, and a laser saurus
Currently: 
@blissdev maybe Hoptoad or New Relic do some of what you're looking for? Those two I've heard of; will have to check out the 2 you mentioned
@mikebranski @tomgiles @stagebloc Sorry for missing out on the Hackathon, this weekend was crazy family time.
@blissdev aha. Apologies.
@gegere come to web 414 december 9th, I'll be taking about git and github ;)
@matthusby wtf. That sucks. Does facebook not have a "log out all other sessions".function like gmail?
@matthusby I don't even log in, to facebook and haven't been on a  wifi network other than @bucketworks with my laptop
Deploy the sheep herder.
@ashedryden the couches, they are too big.
Motherfucking Facebook.
Can't even find the place to edit applications that I've authed through Facebook, and I used to do some Facebook app development. FB fail.
This is pretty stupid and evil from Facebook: 
Deauthorize everything, unfriend everyone, reset passwords, and go hide in my cave until the next epoch.
@matthusby I don't think the 100's of millions of avg users on Facebook should have to know how set up a VPN to use Facebook. That's silly.
@jclermont I've been testing Tower for a couple months and love it, but I still do stuff on the command line.
@mikebranski everything is coming up aces today. But yes, I need to get off that server; other ppl's sites have repeatedly been compromised.
Right now, I'm about one cellphone crash away from packing out all up and going to live off-the-grid in the mountains.
I wasn't having issues w/ my phone, but I got about 10 replies. Previous tweet was about my facebook being hijacked & my site getting hacked
@mikebranski Will be pointing the mattgauger.com domain to my new, (secured!) linode instance & blog.mattgauger to posterous. Thanks again.
If you need passwords, look no further than this gist: 
now that I made that, I forgot what I needed a password for.
Godaddy decided to park my domain name for 12 hours while switching namservers. Not  awesome.
@blissdev that's what instapaper is for!
@cswingler registering with godaddy isn't so bad so long a you immediately point to another nameserver
@Strabd +1
@ashedryden i'm the best!
My changes to DNS appears to be about halfway from oblivion or success. We'll see in a couple hours.
Parts of Arcade Fire's The Suburbs sound like U2. Other parts sound like The Birthday Massacre's Kill the Lights. Still enjoying this album.

This is really cool: 
@KeVroN skip ahead to the minority report-style interface
@svdodge so learn Drupal 7. It's been fairly stable for a long time.
@whil you speak of ancient lore. We all use cellphone OSes built on top of Unix flavors now, & don't have to deal with any of that nonsense.
I want a mac fullscreen ebook reader that looks like Reeder for Mac: 
My cellphone has Flash but my laptop (outside of chrome) does not. Strange future we live in.
@chernowa I just tried to use 8pen but I can't get it to recognize gestures, even on my giant droid x screen. My fingers are too fat.
@chernowa plus it does a lot of UI no-no's like blocking the text area that I'm typing in. back to swype for me.
@chernowa architect  (auto correct) will be stage (the) death of me.
@chernowa swype is my favorite, but it was in beta on my phone before it was available in the marketplace, so I've had it since September.
Maintenance guy has succeeded in sliding washer/dryer around and tipping it over. It is apparently now 'fixed'

@ashedryden Unfortunately the people that review apps only get an executable, and don't review code. One could still insert malicious code.

@ickyb0d which ReadyNAS do you have?
Sadly not enough time to find an embedded PC to build @bucketworks a  compliant coffeepot during devhouse
@raster the rfc defines a joke protocol for coffee pots, so I'd need an ethernet or wifi shield. +I don't have time to go buy the coffeemakr
@raster the IRL version would need a SBC powerful enough to run a webserver reporting status of coffee + lowlevel sensors to sense the state
@raster the webapp could keep track of # of pots of coffee, current temp, time since last pot was made. Made put some simple JS graphs on it
@raster and @ashedryden was joking that it should require @bucketworks RFID cards to dispense coffee; then we could have a leader board.
@raster if I was smart I'd have ordered sensors to start low-level integration. Sparkfun has nice digital thermometer chips.
@raster needs a real time clock for recording times & the network connection rules out arduino alone. Not energy efficient to run a whole PC
@raster thinking I'd need a baseboard or gumstix computer for this. Or a SheevaPlug.
@raster not trying to shoot down your ideas. I actually think an Arduino + Relayshield would be a good controller (
@raster But I'd rather have Linux to write a webapp on. Ethernet shields for Arduino are limited, basically just allow basic TCP/IP.
@raster (sorry for all the replies, hard to get technical content across in 140 characters)
@raster ok. see you then :-)
@raster I've got a spare Arduino. I can probably go buy a digital coffeemaker. Anyone from @mkemakerspace want to bring an oscilloscope?
@raster @mkemakerspace If I grab a digitally-controlled coffee pot we can probably skip the AC relays and control it by wiring up digital IO
@mkemakerspace @raster If we can somehow integrate a Kinect to do gesture-based coffee brewing, I think we can get on MAKEzine blog ;-)
@mkemakerspace @raster pretty sure a digital coffeepot has relays controlled by pushbutton. I was hoping it's as simple as pulling that high
@raster @mkemakerspace We can work on ideas & the web app code tonight @Bucketworks during DevHouse, and work on hardware at @mkemakerspace?
@raster but this will improve both @BarCampMKE and @Bucketworks ;-)

RT @ashedryden: Who's going to MilwaukeeDevHouse5 tonight? What are you working on?
Setting up for MKE DevHouse. #mkedh5
@tomhenrich We're pretty well stocked for tables. Power strips always welcome!
@raster the NSLU2 has a USB port, right?
@raster I can always use more little servers to keep my Sun Cobalt Qube 3 company.
Roughly 120 tabs open last night, down to 5 essential tabs. Was doing a lot of research / API lookup last night at #mkedh5 though.
@joshdean what time? We'll pick you up! @ashedryden
@raster working on it now, actually.
as nice as it is outside I'm glad I'm not biking.

@dujoducom yes, they're on clearance since apparently no one buys electronics components in a store anymore.
@roycepipkins maybe you can find the USB version. I only found the serial version.
@roycepipkins the Parallax sonar was still $32 at RadioShack though, fairly certain it is cheaper online.
.@3liza finally hung this: 
.@3liza take two, less blurry edition 
Watched the first episode of Walking Dead while doing the annual seal-the-windows-for-winter routine. Zombies are awesome, but gross.
Found an Arduino. Going to breadboard the PIR sensor to play with tonight. Woot!
@plural I forgot to install FTDI drivers on my new MBP. Last night I was using @raster's Arduino Uno, which doesn't need drivers.
MBP still not seeing the Arduino or a /dev/tty.usb* device even. Hrmph.
Motion sensor works! Orange LED is it detecting me taking this picture. Hat is to cover the sensor during warm-up. 
@thebestsophist I only have the zombie survival guide. @tomhenrich
@cthielen next up is to get one of the RFID readers working. but maybe tomorrow ;)
WE NEED TO GO DEEPER. #intoTheNextDream #sleep
Good, err, morning.
The first cup of coffee is the best.
@raster bayshore radioshack is supposed to have them, according to an inside source.
Apparently some spam blog network has decided my name has some SEO juice. Not sue whether to be honored or not.
@raster sorry about that. you can have one of mine! :)
@tomhenrich and maybe corn.
@tomhenrich corn is a grain, not a vegetable.
@gilesgoatboy I keep meaning to start a laundromat that will txt you when a load is done, free wifi, & rent the upstairs as a yoga studio.
@gilesgoatboy Yoga because you're already likely in comfy clothes and have an hour or so to kill.
@raster just two rfid readers.
@darrickhartman I've got email older than that in gmail.
mattgauger.com (nothing there yet), ashedryden.com and comingoutpoly.com moved to the new Linode virtual machine. Liking Linode a lot.
@raster @darrickhartman in that case, I've got hard drives from old Linux boxes that would turn up email from even earlier. '98 or so.
@raster @ashedryden "freedom isn't free. unless it's Firefox!" new slogan?
@raster the standards for email are huge, complex, and annoying. I do not envy the person who has to maintain a 30,000 line Sendmail config.
@raster I thought it'd be easy to test that a service as simple as email is working on server, but it's not. Too many edge cases & weirdness
It's days like this that one is glad they ignored the millions of people telling me to just use Tumblr as my blog.
Mixed up the last tweet's subject but it still gets the idea across. Brain needs more coffee.
@narkalant Super-Tiny Chameleon Photographed in Madagascar : TreeHugger 
@raster depends on the piezo element. I've found it's best to consult the datasheet.. if it has one. @mkemakerspace
@raster Pretty sure 15000Khz is beyond normal hearing range. Human hearing is 15hz to 20,000hz at best @mkemakerspace
@tomhenrich I was not impressed by the Zombies Versus Robots graphic novel. Just letting you know.
@raster yeah who uses email?!
@raster the best part about facebook? Not having to set up your own Sendmail server to talk to your friends. #ikeeed
@raster I'm actually looking forward to the day when inbox != [ todo list + calendaring system + keeping up w/ friends & family + identity ]
@raster Problem on many sites is email is login, therefore identity. Password reset only sends to email. OpenID is steps in right direction.
@raster I don't want to manage my OpenID or let that role be taken by something like claimID, though. Not sure what ideal solution is.
@raster I have any number of ways to be contacted, with various levels of appropriateness for different parties. So it should respect that.
@raster Right now email is catch-all for everything: personal communication, calendar items, todo list, spam, receipts, social media, etc.
@antifuchs had I realized you were looking for an apt in SF & @abraham was too, I should have introduced you to each other.
@antifuchs @abraham you two should at least meet up some time ;)
RT @BlytheWoolston: Dear Librarians: I love you. Always have.
@github hooray! I'm giving a talk on Thursday about git and Github. :-)
@tomhenrich I have done both on the same window in the past. Nothing is perfect.
@hypnagogic @willowbl00 My favorite math prof used art & animation in Mathematica to illustrate Calculus; I found I grasped more.
@hypnagogic @willowbl00 I realized I got implications of new material because I had a "visceral" understanding of how it worked underneath.
@DASchenkel yes, I'm talking about git on thurs @web414 at @bucketworks. Sounds like a plan, see you there!
If NASA ran the #WarOnDrugs: Spend billions of dollars on a drug bust every 2-5 years, then hold press conf announcing weed found next door.
If TSA ran the #WarOnDrugs: Wait in hours line at your pharmacy &a drug test to get a prescription. Confiscate Nailclippers you just bought.
Exhausted and freezing but going to try to make it out to the @mkemakerspace meeting later.
@jennaddenda no one on the IT Crowd has that accent.
Mmm. Pizza soup. (It wasn't supposed to be pizza soup, but that is what it tastes like)
@raster @blissdev Very very cool. I am going to add Seriality to my ever-growing list of things to play with and learn.
@jasonbot2000 @raster Arduinos emulate Serial-over-USB. USB is the wires, serial is the protocol/method of communication.
Heading to @mkemakerspace.
RT @ptorrone: "any sufficiently advanced hobby is indistinguishable from a job" - from a reader, nice.
@ralphholzmann cool! Any chance for an in-person demo after @web414?
Gas exploded all over my gloves, hand & the side of the car while pumping. This is one reason why I didn't want to own another car. Blech.
@joshdean I don't think the rubber "fume recovery" gasket worked. That's how the pump knows the tank is full. It was after the tank was full
I kind of want a show where @donttrythis and Jamie solve crimes and at the end at the court case, they shout "This case is busted!"
Had a good time at @mkemakerspace & excited to have the free time to spend there in January (thx @ashedryden) Going to stay up and code now.
@abraham Is that an oven or a dishwasher?
@abraham oh wow. that is tiny tiny. even my 300 sqft studio apartment in Kenosha had bigger appliances than that.
After a lot of fuss to get a Rails pre-3.0.0 app upgraded to work on Rails 3.0.1, then getting MongoDB to play nice, RSpec can't run w/o AR.
Really don't want to continue without RSpec. TDD for this set of technologies is too ingrained.
@svdodge Oh. Come to MKE Ruby User's Group on December 20th and find out!
I suppose I should work more on my presentations. What with the terrible, horrible insomnia I'm experiencing. Nerves? What are those?
Wow, I can tell I was tired last night. RSpec-rails won't work without ActiveRecord. But I can just use plain RSpec and it works great.
Got a flu shot. Need more coffee.
@zacwitte skatepark with ramps for fixie tricks. It is SF, after all.
@jclermont no one asked me!
Everyone is sick. I can't afford to be sick right now. Everyone stay away from me!
@cthielen textmate ftw. Install the bundles here: 
When it rains, it pours a lot more than you'd expect.
It's been almost a year since I made a pot of coffee in my Chemex beaker. Hopefully it will be tasty.
@tomhenrich damnit. I'm not done with work yet, much refining my presentations! #zZx #napSoundsGood.
Lost my wallet. Commence freakout and hoping it didn't get left at Walgreens.
Pretty sure my wallet is gone. Walgreens stafff didn't find it. Have torn apart  the apartment. Getting really worried.
Things that are annoying: @tafferinspace running around on the new furniture & us, covered in his own poop. Oh, and listing my wallet.
Woke up this morning to The Land of Lisp song stuck in my head. Still stuck. I need to get that book! Video: 
@jclermont I was pointed to that by @ashedryden but didn't have the time to read it. I branch for new features or bug fixes and merge after.
Keeping an eye out for UPS/FedEx/etc just *in case* there's Chrome OS netbooks on the way for me or @ashedryden.
@Kurt_McAllister The Dropkick Murphys?
I like to think that staying healthy while everyone else is getting the winter flu / plague is good preparation for the zombie apocalypse.
.@raster an accurate view of Github to the beginner is my guess ;-) Everyone come to @Web414 tonight and find out! I'll be talking about git
@abraham According to @GitHub I'm the #1 developer by follows in Milwaukee. That can't be right.. 
@knellotron @raster  Yes. Also, I'd like to through in there to use  to backup the generated files to S3.
@knellotron @raster It'd be more expensive than free to use duplicity but I can eat some of that cost to ensure we have good backups.
@tomhenrich you should come hear me talk at @web414!
@raster @knellotron We'll see. Possibly. 
@raster @knellotron We can have cron do some fancy admin stuff, like queue up uncompressed video, compress, upload to blip or archive.org.
Keynote is for perfectionists. It is driving my OCD crazy.

Hey! I'm live on Ustream from my Android phone -  - 19:23 PM Dec 9
@DanMHamlin sorry it is off my phone. Audio will be	bit lacking
@tomhenrich nearly 2011. We skipped the rockets-and-jetpacks future and are aiming squarely for Idiocracy.
@gruber coming up with a McGruber themesong. @ashedryden is not impressed. "He's-knows-tons-about-macs-and-he'll-rate-iPhone-apps,McGruber!"
@ckittel send me on to find out. I'll let you know, uh, eventually.
Forgot to stream my talk last night. Luckily we had a video camera running. I'll tet to get that online.
@jclermont Thank you. I learned a lot from @ralphholzmann; his presentation was great & he's a huge asset to our community here. #web414
@web414 Here's my slides from last night:  I'll have a blog post in a few minutes. #web414
Just published my blog post that accompanies my talk:  #web414 @web414 @jclermont
@raster my blog post and my @web414 talk were about you! sorta. 
@tomhenrich but how much takeout & how much other meat did you eat? Just trying to put it in perspective. Frzn ground beef isn't appetizing.
@raster I just didn't have the time to finish that feature myself w/ how busy I've been. I'd still like to get it working.
I think I'm going to start unfollowing all terrible puns, starting with anyone who makes a Ricky Weeks / Wikileaks joke.
@raster I found that too. Did you set the PIR sensor's jumper to fire only once and then wait, or fire every time motion is detected?
@raster I had mine hooked up to a piezo buzzer, which buzzes at about the same frequency as a fire alarm when fed a PWM of 128. #loud
I'm on my way to the @mkemakerspace. But first, a stopping on a quick errand to get @ashedryden an early Christmas present.
CarTalk on NPR! @ashedeyden doesn't let me listen to it  when she's on the car.
@knellotron can you stick the script on pastebin or gist.github.com & I'll try it on a P4 & AMD dualcore just to see what CPU power we need?
@mkemakerspace the 15th str radio shack is it of rfid readers now. Wasn't able to grab any. Sorry.
have to go move the car because the landlord has declared a snow emergency for the lot. I'd call it a wind emergency. Hopefully I survive.
Ice block that was a car is now chipped out. At alterra  foundry enjoying a cup of coffee and watching it snow (really just blow around)
Waiting for the wind to die down a little before I get out if the car. A dumpster got pushed across a snowy parking lot & hit a car at speed
Added to bad puns unfollow filter: Any mention of the word 'Metrodome' for a 48 hour period.
@tomhenrich Lots of people keep talking about how they want to make twitter clients that filters X or by method Y. Expect a lot of them soon
It was stupid to decide to shave. My face is chewed up more than Edward James Olmos.
@mkemakerspace @roycepipkins @raster my RFID reader in action 
@roycepipkins @raster Pretty sure the police robot just broke the window with a bomb-disarming cannon. The police used a pole to insert gas.
@roycepipkins @raster Here's the code I used  Arduino makes a good little USB serial terminal
Serial monitor showing cards being read. Dunno why I thought to erase the cards; they're unique IDs. @mkemakerspac 
@Strabd is there a demo running anywhere? Screenshots? Is it even as far along as Diaspora?
@Strabd I just signed up on daisycha.in as well. This looks *a lot* like status.net.. is it a fork?
@Strabd The favicon is status.net & FAQ says they are running status.net inside GNU Social. Add me: 
@zacwitte the books Algorithms of the Intelligent Web (java) & Programming Collective Intelligence (python) are about recommend. engines etc
@zacwitte I have both but have yet to read them (which should make me more intelligent, har har)
@trodrigues do you use everpaper?
@trodrigues the archive-to-evernote just sounds like it would be useful to you right now, is all.
@mkemakerspace yes, they can.(saw that a few weeks ago) and so I erased the number that actually keys me in to @bucketworks ;)
@tomhenrich you hate space hippies, folk music & the 70's?
@tomhenrich don't make me call out The Matrix for the humans-as-batteries stuff.
@tomhenrich I love Gonk droids D:
Made a stepper motor bristle bot. That might be a world first. The cats are obsessed with watching it skitter around the apartment.

@abraham That and hanging out with @plural ;-)
OH: "oh, that crashed." Presenter on his Chrome notebook not supporting WebGL & crashing on slides.html5rocks.com/#canvas3d
RT @tapps: FREE CHROME NOTEBOOK? yeah. thanks google you're awesome
Chrome notebook! 
Love this 
@plural thank you for having us! :D @tapps
@joshjs I had that playlist for awhile. The transitions work!
@littletinyfish @raster I never got an invite either. On some servers they keep nuking the DBs & annoying users when their accounts vanish.
@littletinyfish @raster I have run Diaspora locally, but it requires a lot of packages, not any old LAMP server. Not ready for primetime yet
@raster @ashedryden that was fun and maybe has more content packed into it than the session we were emulating.
I recommend Feather for #newtwitter. Works on Safari, Chrome, and even installed fine on my Chrome CR-48: 
Having a Chrome Cr-48 notebook means I'm redoing my presentation for @mkepug tonight on GDocs.

Anyone else unable to load @twitpic images, ever?
@gregtarnoff it is only a browser. So you get the Chrome inspector & any webapps online. You could use bespin or kodingen, but not practical
.@MeltingIce both, but the twitpic site with the larger image never loads for me. Thumbnail in,#newtwitter works. Sometimes.
@MeltingIce I dont use ad block and it happens on my phone, all three of my computers and on my home and work networks.
@MeltingIce For example, still waiting for this image of me to load as I type this 
@gregtarnoff Watch my blog, I'm going to write a post about making it more useful as a dev machine stock, & by flipping the dev mode switch.
.@gregtarnoff read this post from @jeresig about using the Cr-48 as a dev machine: 
@MeltingIce nope. Standard cable modem or over Verizon 3G. I've seen load times go up significantly on the images only. Not pages, CSS, etc.
@MeltingIce Lately I click through to Twitpic, don't see the image after 10-20 seconds, & leave. The rest of the page has loaded, of course.
@MeltingIce Nothing fishy that I can see. (hops out on the West Coast still around 35ms)
@MeltingIce It's possible that routing is taking different paths at different times; hard to observe. No one else said they noticed this.
Hashbrowns or fries? That is the question.
@sfradkin 
I want to go work remote thanks to my Cr-48. Somewhere that is experiencing summer right now, like Argentina or New Zealand. #dreambig
@np7776 not me, nope.
Ever since I sliced up my index finger on the Cr-48 box, my typing speed & accuracy have gone down. How does that fit into "don't be evil"?!
I'm chargin' mah JAAAVAAASCRIPTS
@DanMHamlin there's kodingen, bespin & etherpad, but I don't use them. Planning to write a blog post: EC2 micro instance, screen, vim, git.
@DanMHamlin the Cr-48 has a shell that only has like 5 commands, called crosh. But it has an SSH client. Just can't do public key auth :/
@ralphholzmann what did you use for your html slides at @web414? Forgot to ask.
Being a good Samaritan: in an emergency, run to where I see cop cars for help, nearly get arrested for interrupting a drug bust/crime scene.

I want to know how @abraham constantly shares things from blogs in my GReader before the real blog subscription post shows up.
Being real coffee today with the Arduino-equipped coffee pot! 
Brewing real coffee rather.
There's a reason why you should over-engineer everything: it sucks trying to get fragile stuff to work.
@abraham no, your shared item shows up a few minutes before the real blog post does. It's odd. I'll screenshot it next time.
Futurama makes me LOL.
For some people, coding is a way to pay the bills. For the rest of us, our work is significant & we need a philosophy.

@lageekitude I heard a 15 minute power nap after downing an espresso-Kahlúa is interesting. Never tried it.
@lageekitude minus the alcohol and substitute in a red espresso (red tea aka rooibos put through an espresso machine at pressure) then.
@lageekitude Which, of course, doesn't have any caffeine on its own but tastes delicious.
So it turns out Ruby's case doesn't have fall-through (like C's switch cases) which is why I've never used it for anything. Interesting.

Ruby on Rails + PHP/LAMP coder now available for freelance, contact and FT work. DM or email matt.gauger@gmail.com to get in touch.
@blissdev I'd say you could DIY fix it if you're enterprising, but since it likely involves opening outdoor cable box & running new coax, no
@blissdev not to mention that coax is notoriously hard to use a tone box on (to measure signal quality) since it may have splitters, etc
@Arlen B&N at Mayfair?
@blissdev Also, if your house is getting cable from a pole, you'd need a bucket truck or bucket lift to replace that outdoor cable.

Guitar pedal extravaganza 
Dear fire: please die under this pile of snow. cc: @evq @ashedryden
@raster I have found the effects and amp emulation in the new Garageband to be pretty cool. Playing with the lessons and Magic Garageband.
@raster I'm running an Art TubeMP Studio microphone preamp (12ax7 tube preamp for voice, I just watch my gain for guitar) into my MBP lineIn
@raster I've got more pedals in the closet; those are just the ones I was playing. Not that I want to have a "who has more pedals" contest;)
@raster For historical reasons, a lot of guitarists avoid those digital effects things. Mainly because the early ones sounded like crap.
@raster Let me know if you need any pedals for February. I've got a whole ton of fuzzes, and a small selection of reverb, delay & chorus.
@raster My issue is the several millisecond (or more) lag between when I first strike a note and when I hear it in my monitors..
@raster And I have a 2.8Ghz i7, so the fastest laptop that Apple makes, there shouldn't be any lag :P
@raster  ART tube preamp into MBP's line in. I don't have a firewire interface. Too expensive right now.
@raster So, that all said, maybe expect some music from me in February.

@antifuchs Use Terminal.app ?
@antifuchs Neither let you drag a tab to a new window AFAIK
12VAC (not DC) wall wart plugged in near a VGA cable makes for some crazy wavy video signal.
@gilesgoatboy I just want a software drum machine that works like a 880: a bunch of presets. I don't want to program beats from scratch.
@gilesgoatboy limiting factors are that I am doing rock/alt-country, not electronic music, and I'm not a fan of any of Garageband's loops.
@gilesgoatboy Not because I think beat programming is easy, but  because I know that I don't know how to do it ;)
@gilesgoatboy and the Roland Dr 880 is far better than most of the crappy "band in a pocket" boxes that do drums.
@gilesgoatboy ArkX rock-mode or even just Ruby script would be amazing, and I could potentially understand what it was doing and tweak it.
@gilesgoatboy A real solution (since most hardware drum machines that aren't for electronic music sound like shit) is to use a real drum kit
@gilesgoatboy but I don't have the time or money to buy a drum kit & learn. I was planning to record in the RPM Challenge in February ;)
@gilesgoatboy "Make me a beat" would be a great webapp. User sets it up, preview, charge different costs for different file format downloads
@gilesgoatboy And my describing what I do as "rock/alt-country" is wrong. I've got a guitar live-looping+noise rig. Think Andrew Bird.
@gilesgoatboy Maybe if I had a Gameboy I'd use this Korg DS-10 thing, but I don't, heh. 
@gilesgoatboy Guy I know through the interwebs just made this demo of the DS-10 thing: 
Off to the @mkemakerspace to hack on audio gear and maybe stick around until later when for Electronics Night. See you there!

@Strabd All my crazier pedals, including a few modded Dano mini pedals, are on the noise rig (separate signal chain)
@Strabd eventually I'd like to get a Digitech DL-4 delay, a wah, and a distortion pedal I actually like (tried lots, haven't been impressed)
@Strabd Err, s/Digitech DL-4/Line 6 DL4/ .. I get confused :P
@Strabd And that all goes into a laptop running SooperLooper 
@svdodge There's many editors on android, but for some reason I stuck with that one.
I wonder if someone could play the Rock Band drums as a MIDI controller for music (as a real instrument). Possible, @plural? @raster

@raster We're creating a handmade music group at the @mkemakerspace, to talk about instruments, audio gear, synths, recording, etc.
@raster I suppose I should just skip drums/beats then and my guitar loop a percussive track..
@ashedryden and no gel/product needed! I have magical sentient hair.
@raster @plural or maybe my "beats" can be a really simple 8-bit sounding sequencer, if I can build one at the Makerspace before February.

Studio headphones can reproduce really loud noise. Guitar pedal chain is only mono. Playing into guitar chain w/ headphones = one sore ear.
I need to make a box that simply converts mono signal to stereo headphone jack. That is, I need to stop blasting noise into my left ear.
I need some inspiration. Hit me, internet.
@Arlen Because I'm not going out to Radioshack in this weather.

@svdodge I take it it wasn't cycle-able out there?
@svdodge Time for a Pugsley!
@svdodge Or we could build a Pugsley tandem, 4-wheeler or some strange mutant of that sort, at the @mkemakerspace.
@ashedryden Not sure whether that's a compliment. I shower every day. And I brush my teeth! I think I deserve better than "moderately clean"
@svdodge great for getting a full "trunk" of groceries, too.
@littletinyfish @svdodge I'd just make it a side-by-side. Two mountain bike frames and a steering linkage in front?
@KeVroN @littletinyfish @svdodge Or a trike rear axle (if I recall, the Bike Collective had a few) welded to two mountain bike frames.

@ralphholzmann Just curious, how can you be sure that cases of autism aren't underreported among the Amish? @andythompson
@ralphholzmann Or that autism, being in the media, isn't being over-reported in our country instead of another diagnosis? @andythompson
@ralphholzmann 100 years ago, there were many cases of mental retardation, which were a huge range of symptoms & conditions lumped together.
@ralphholzmann Autism is certainly a big hot-button topic and I'm not trying to step into the fray with my own opinions.
@ralphholzmann I don't have  a specific report on this, I'm just saying that mental retardation was a blanket term then, autism is now.
@ralphholzmann (tweets are too short for this.) Correlation in this case doesn't imply causation, especially with bias for the term autism.

Seriously, Jenkins? There isn't a Git plugin for the latest stable release? And your documentation sucks.
@sfradkin the bug is: it's written in Java.
@sfradkin it's a bad idea to rewrite architecture all the time. However, if CI servers were OSes, Jenkins would be like using Win95 in 2011.
Task is: $ git clone URI; bundle; rake # to run tests. After fighting with XML, env vars & user perms, JVM ran out of memory. Insanely bad.
.@sfradkin Jenkins was clearly designed for a world where it's ok that one person's full time job is maintaining CI & config can take days.
@CoderTrader isn't resorting to perf tuning the JVM a little extreme to run a shell script and a ruby task?
@sfradkin  is totally the future and a breath of fresh air. We just can't run it on client code, currently.

@rathboma I have the problem of my GPS "snapping back" to where my apartment is when I start a run/ride on Trailrunner.

Looks like rain is going to keep us from doing Ride the Drive this morning. Oh well. There's always every other day of the year to ride.
@thebestsophist Lion has a lot of fail. I am not going to upgrade.
@gilesgoatboy Possibly relevant to your interests.. 
Crisis over what style of shoe to wear at this point in my life. Continue wearing childish skate shoes? Pretend to be a rich white guy? Ugh.
@devn I dunno man, I don't like loafers or oxfords, don't want skate shoes. Considerations for comfortable-while-biking rule most out.
@Strabd Doc Martens actually come in vegan varieties.
@Strabd 
Finally retired the bent Trubo saddle on my fixie. Using a WTB from @ashedryden's bike. If this doesn't work, I'll get a Turbo clone.
We lucked out; test ride to see how this new saddle feels started with rain. But the sun has come out and it is beautiful cycling weather.
Looks like we got home right on time. Pouring rain now. ~9mi with @ashedryden today despite the rain showers and long stretches of sunlight.

Just did bike maintenance & figured out why my front brake seemed gritty: a 1/8" piece of metal. Who knows how long it has been there.
Brake pad with a chunk of metal: 
@svdodge @littletinyfish @JoeSteve you guys ever get a metal chunk embedded in a brake pad & gouges on the rim? Metal may be the alloy rim..
@svdodge it was big enough to make me lose a lot of braking power in the rain/wet today. Ant idea what causes them?
Brakes are too fiddly -- my next bike is getting drum brakes!
@svdodge maybe a coaster brake. Or disc brakes, but I don't know that those are any easier..
@littletinyfish  Good to know. I got new pads, just to be safe. Only noticed the grinding today, but dunno how long it had been building up.

@rohdesign I'm quite partial to the @EighthInch Amelia wheelset. @blissdev built up an old Schwinn Le Tour with them & I was impressed.
@rohdesign simplicity, durability. Less to steal, although SS/fixie bikes might be more of a target for theft now. I prefer gears now, tho.
@rohdesign For a city bike, something with an internally geared hub seems ideal, in my current opinion. They come in 3,5, or 8 speeds.
@theycallmebrant the proper generic name is "refridgerant" yes?

@Strabd I'm trying to see if it makes sense to migrate my personal wiki/notes from Simplenote to Octopress. Similar use case as yours?
@Strabd Yeah, I'm seeing it's the wrong system. I don't need online-editing (I much prefer to maintain a git repo & have it build from that)
@Strabd But things like person-by-person ACLs to various content aren't built in at all,and that's kinda what I'd like to move towards.
@Strabd I had a git-wiki branch that did the same git-repo document thing as Jekyll/Octopress but that is long unmaintained.

@tomhenrich free idea: WYSIWYG websites for restaurants w/some sort of incentive to switch to it. Great design is a given, not enough reason
@tomhenrich we did some market research in prep for a YC entry. Most restaurant owners didn't think their website was earning them $
@tomhenrich & they wouldn't switch to a free service, even if it was a better experience.
@svdodge the fact that they'd paid for a site in the past made them against a free site service like I was proposing. CC @tomhenrich

@svdodge yes, I could tell. Why not rear rack with market-bag panniers?
@svdodge Plus, I need fatter tires if I'm going to carry more load. 32c Gatorskins at 90-ish psi just didn't feel like enough cushion.

@littletinyfish @svdodge Gonna go check out what options local bike shop has for me. Not sure about skinnier tire in the winter, though.
@littletinyfish @svdodge Maybe I can cut the front fender forward of the brake mount (where it rubs) & rotate the fender up, zip tie to fork
@littletinyfish @svdodge Essentially, make the front one fit like a SKS Race Blade: 
@raster 8% I think. Don't quote me on that. CC @jremsikjr @bendyworks
@svdodge @littletinyfish LBS recommended a Sheldon Brown bracket. Going to see if that will work before committing to cutting or new tires.
@littletinyfish @svdodge Scratch that idea; fender is physically as far up against the fork as it can be, LBS guy didn't know what I meant.

Wishing I still had the @mkemakerspace at my disposal :(
@jremsikjr set for 7pm. @ashedryden
@jremsikjr we can delay a bit :)
@svdodge fender & mount were physically against the fork crown, so there wasn't much I could do.. I cut it like this: 
@svdodge It wasn't so much the fenders not fitting as the fork not having enough space to let the fender fit in there. Track bike and all..

Ok, Madisonians. Who has the best freshly-roasted coffee for me to but whole bean? Just Coffee seems a clear favorite..

@planetbike fork crown wouldn't let the fender go any higher. I mounted behind the brake bolt & cut the front off, allowing it to go higher.
@planetbike This picture may explain the problem & solution a little better: 
Lentils on their own are pretty bland. I forgot tortillas, so I had to eat burrito fillings ala carte for lunch.

It is *so*	windy out today in Madison on the isthmus. Go figure that @ashedryden & I would be out running errands. So sunny though!
@svdodge @ashedryden yeah, she hates tandem bikes. HATES THEM.
@gregtarnoff plus Bunky's sucks (and isn't really Italian) @ashedryden
@tomhenrich do not panic. breathe slowly. the meat police are on their way.
@svdodge although i had fun thoughts of a tandem drag race where there is only one rider, on the back seat, and a straight shot course.
@svdodge also, free idea from thinking about the gears on the tandems: CVT hubs. They have CV transmissions for snowmobiles, why not bikes?
@svdodge related: Saw heavily discounted-for-winter Schwinn hybrids at the bike store. 8 speed Shimano internal hub. Tempting.
@svdodge This thing:   The colors are growing on me. For a grocery-getter + winter bike, it'd be fairly nice to have.
@svdodge I was looking for a singlespeed/3-spd townie bike but no luck. But this w/ drop bars, fenders, rear racks, better saddle?
@svdodge Granted the Nexus thumb shift won't go on curved bars, but I've seen several solutions to that.
@svdodge I dunno. maybe upright bars? Brainstorming. Flat bars don't give me enough options.

Gah. Bike trailer broke free on the last block, got caught in my spikes and bent up my wheel & fender.

@jonnyfixedgear yep, fine. some lady stopped to help, but when i said there were no kids in the trailer she gave me the stinkeye & drove off

@svdodge initial Trek Triton impressions: nice, light bike. Lite bottom bracket. Brakes on only the drop bar hoods is hard to adjust to.

@planetbike After reading your FAQ, realized that the bike shop that installed the rack on my GF's bike didn't give us any of the hardware:(

@listrophy @edwardog The only problem was, I was using @1password on my Android phone as I installed apps. Didn't have Dropbox or even gmail
Seriously, I found a lot of parts of Android easier and faster to use than this iPhone.
Granted, I spent nearly two years learning and tweaking Android. It was integrated with my brain. iOS simply is a "the one way" brick wall.
The iOS browser Greader is far clunkier than the native app on Android. It took me longer to read my feeds, likely due to the small font.

.@joshjs @jregan @boblmartens I paid for 3 iphones last night, the last thing I want to do right now is pay for apps.

@jclermont surprise someone who works online would actually want to use Google products in the first place..
@boblmartens I don't own a TV or own any DVDs anymore. Not everyone's use case is the same as yours.
@boblmartens the new android phones on Sprint aren't a real leap from my Droid X, despite 2 years of progress.
@jclermont don't be a troll.
So this is a complaint. The iPhone still hasn't synced my contacts & it is set up according to Google's instructions 
@LordLobo I'm unhappy with the lack of integration and amount of friction to my personal workflow.
@joshjs because paying rent is overrated.
@joshjs Didn't just buy one iphone, bought 3x iPhone 4s's with Applecare+.
I forgot that is not OK to be unhappy with an Apple product. Still totally OK to make jokes about other people's unhappiness on the internet
I dared to expect more from an expensive product. And forgot that we should all be apathetic consumer whores. My bad, guys. As you were.

@sfradkin @dubharmonic every app market is going to have crap. The thing is, you don't use the crap.

Gmail app on iPhone cant send from multiple accounts. (ie my google apps for domains accounts) This is a critical feature for my job. WTF?
Seriously, the solution is not to just pick one email account and have that be the only account you can send email from your iPhone as.
Regretting buying an iPhone every day. Not being able to send from my multiple Google accts is a dealkiller. Bite me if you think otherwise.
Tired of fanboys attacking me because I'm not in love with a device that doesn't let me get shit done, all b/c I'm not the "intended market"
@romke Neither Gmail app or Mail.app support sending as my other accts, which is already set up in Gmail.
@romke And adding Google Sync for Domains means removing my Gmail acct sync, per Google's instructions.
Seriously people, I don't want to hear "Of course Google is going to make apps on Android that integrate with Google services better." &gt;.&lt;
@romke @axiixc @ejknapp Followed google sync instructions, but I found a known issue preventing Apps for Domains & Gmail at the same time.
The closest I've been to sending mail from my google apps for domain account; will never accept the correct password. 
And no, I don't have 2-factor auth turned on for that Google Apps for Domains account.
@ejknapp Gmail != Google Apps for Domains, and google recommends you set them both up as Exchange (Google Sync) accounts.
@sfradkin I'd go back to a modern Android phone (Cyanogenmod 2.4 was pretty good) but Sprint has nothing I want & it's too late to switch.
It's as if it was OK for my MBP to not be able to run development apps & people would say that I'm not in the use case of email & Facebook.
Give up, nuke config from orbit. Try again. that's how I got my Gmail account to do Google Sync correctly in the first place..
@boblmartens I am using mail, you have to use Mail.app to sync contacts and have multiple accounts
I mean, maybe people enjoy spending hours setting up email on their mobile device. I'd rather be GETTING SHIT DONE.
I must be dumb b/c I've spent hours trying to set this up, read guides etc. & it works for everyone else. I retract my complaints & give up.
Fully see how @bryanl was right when he told me to always pay full price for a phone and not get a 2 year contract.
So I can sync all my mail by setting my work email as Exhange &my gmail as IMAP but then I have duplicate mail & no filters anymore #cantwin

@thebestsophist @ashedryden that is, professors must use the book(s) for their course from whatever publisher their school/dept has chosen.

@listrophy granted, 13K feet is tiny.
@listrophy I suppose if the weather balloons gets the rocket to 80K feet, then launching at that point will go much farther than 13K ft.
@listrophy So the next question becomes, will the FAA / DHS even let us build and launch something like that? :P
@listrophy what's interesting is that the high-engineering, bipropellant approach is probably safer & more predictable than "hobby" rocketry
@listrophy "hobby" rocketry being essentially putting a bunch of explosives in a field and hoping when you light it, that it goes up.

@myronmarston config/configure method name was our first change. We're using 1.11.3 and the docs are all for 2.0rc, backwards deprecation?
@myronmarston yes, indeed. The solution was simply to go into the 1.11.3 release tag in Github and read the docs as they appeared then.
@myronmarston the real problem is that we're still using VCR 1.11.3 and not the 2.0rc that's on Github.

@gesa You can do stuff like that in SASS, assuming overall width can be computed and stored in a variable.

@gilesgoatboy I'm so glad Rails jumped the shark / is old and busted. Now the fanboys won't get in the way while I'm getting shit done.
@gilesgoatboy that said, I'm all about the CoffeeScript these days. Preaching the good word of the Coffee and Jasmine at JS meetups, etc.
@thebestsophist My assumption was that @gesa meant that since the design is responsive, there's no way to make a rule like width: 50% - 2px;
@thebestsophist @gesa But then I realized you might mean that you should compile the SASS to CSS locally: yes. SASS is not for production.
@gesa The solution I've seen is that the CSS sets a reasonable static width of a thing based on the viewport being within a given range.

Just spent an hour cleaning up dotfiles to present to the world. Almost ready -- tons of housecleaning to do on my vim config.

Spending some time designing one idea for our tiny home. This design's inspiration is also our inspiration: 
@thebestsophist I just get tired of playing font face pickup when the boss gets drunk.

Cats are flexi.
Interlockable cats. 
Designed a house while listening to dubstep. There are no right angles. #awyeah
@tomhenrich oh, there's doors.
@tomhenrich and lots of windows.
The problem I have with most tiny house designs is that there's no storage, no shelves of books, nor personal space to create/make things.
Continuing tiny house riff, I want a combination convertible standing/sitting desk that triples as TV stand, across from office chair &couch
@CoderTrader thinking that we will build an outbuilding that will act as a bike shed, workshop, and potting studio.
@CoderTrader also, budget willing, I want PV panels and a wind turbine, so the outbuilding (bike shed) would house the batteries & charger.
@CoderTrader We've been doing research & collected a bunch of storage ideas. The best untapped ideas might be sailboat interior design.
@toolshedgirl this is true. Very soon cheap ebook readers will replace all my books. My hobbies and need to create things will not, tho.
@thebestsophist working on the current idea I have. @ashedryden isn't 100% sold on it.
@toolshedgirl also if the Tiny House Floor Plans book is to be trusted, we will live in a future where everyone goes to the laundromat.
@toolshedgirl @thebestsophist see also my current favorite cottage 
@toolshedgirl @thebestsophist also this one: 
So @ashedryden is in another room. That means I can put on the dubstep, right?
@CoderTrader @toolshedgirl @thebestsophist also, it would be lulz to put in a "computing furnace" in a crawlspace: 
@toolshedgirl @thebestsophist I'm anti-trailer as far as tiny houses are concerned. I don't want to live in an RV.
@JenRemsik Yep. Not too expensive, either.  But probably doesn't qualify as a tiny house. @thebestsophist @toolshedgirl

@lindseybieda exactly. I have ulterior motives of making the world a better place, too, by making things cheaper/robust.
@lindseybieda (cont'd) and using them in crisis situations where they could provide aid and news coverage of events.
@lindseybieda I always wanted to do the trinity college event!! I had a robot, never got to go (or adapted said robot to fight fires)
@lindseybieda Will consider it. i need to join my local makerspace; I was a member in Milwaukee but was too busy after I moved to join here.
@lindseybieda I'd especially like to tackle it with some of the knowledge I've gained in Udacity's self-driving car class. Vision ftw.
@lindseybieda Which I should say that in the Udacity class I learned localization with probability maths.
@lindseybieda related: a quadcopter/flying robot version of this, set in a real-life scale model house, would be awesome.
So  is looking pretty awesome.
Stress testing a MongoDB server.
@jmbroad Trello is flexible to many different types of proj mgmt, and a little intuitive. Blossom seems a lot more intuitive & less flexible
@jmbroad we are all tool users; we bend the tool at hand to fit our needs.
Anyone have ideas why my laptop takes an absurd time to get to a bash prompt, takes a long time to launch a Rails server? Mem, CPU are fine.
The time it takes to launch a new MacVim window before I can go into insert mode is absurdly slow, too.
@jeffersoncarley yeah, but this is worse than it was a month ago. I thought I'd 'cleaned up' my bash config files, too.
@jmbroad so true. "Bend but not break" is an interesting meta-pattern.
OH: "tomorrow you start at murder."
@aldenhoot I may disable mds/Spotlight, but that doesn't seem to be it. Running Redis, Mongo, and Postgres at once might be to blame.
I'm hard on my laptop. 2 Rails apps running local, Redis, Mongo, Postgres, 3 tmux sessions, ton of Chrome tabs, Pianobar, etc cc @aldenhoot
Sadly, it seems that even with those things running, it's not like I'm pegging the CPU or memory. CPU idling at around 5%, RAM has 1gig free
This Merb 1.0 app sure does boot up fast.
Currently inserting #18375 of 865,000-ish records into MongoDB to stress test it. Takes awhile.
Mongo is doing 60 inserts per second on my box. Not bad.
@myfreeweb Need to get up to 865K records to test something ;)
@myfreeweb Or rather, I'm not testing how long it takes to write it all. I'm concerned with memory, disk and other factors.
And they're large documents, not trivially simple "Foo bar baz" strings.
Adding more cores past 4 isn't going to help your computer feel faster with current CS paradigms. Adding more RAM won't, either.
@CoderTrader it was a dumb thing to attempt, I just want to see the memory usage curve and the disk usage.
job's done!
It took 2 hours to insert 864K records. Oy.
@krainboltgreene My laptop, no SSD, yeah.
To anyone who is wondering, that's just my laptop: 2.8Ghz i7, 4 gigs of RAM, spinny 7200RPM hdd.
And worth noting that I was inserting to Mongo through Ruby/Mongoid because that's where my app lives. Not using mongoimport.

Doing my taxes with my mom. ^_^
So it turns out that TurboTax is a steaming pile of poop in terms of UX and in the fact that it saved someone else's tax return over mine.
@tashitachog my mom had done taxes for clients in 2010 and suddenly one of their returns replaced mine. Hosed the save file. Total crap.
@tashitachog we had just sit down to do it tonight. She has to go home and fill it all in again now. Luckily she remembered all the numbers.
@tashitachog meh. I feel bad for my mom and the fact that the software for accountants / tax preparers is so bad.
So I *did* spend a lot of money on books in 2011 after all. Had to look at more than just Amazon; Kindle is separate, then there's Prag Prog
@tashitachog H&R Block is worse, yeah. Even their software. I'd rather just e-file on the plain form, if I knew all the deductions I needed.
@tashitachog Too bad that they don't just simplify taxes in an effort to get more people to do them correctly.
durr durr laundry.
@tashitachog debated pro's/con's of a flat tax back in HS, don't think I'm up for it anymore. There are upsides and downsides to it.
@tashitachog yeah, simplicity ftw. Also, good UX in a tax preparation software package.. that'd be awesome.
Oh Jeff Tweedy, you sure do know how to make a guy feel lonely and sad and stuff. #wilco

After last night's madMUG/ @madjs, I want to build a server w/ 32gb or 64gb of RAM. Sure, I could spin up on EC2, but that's not as cool.
@LordLobo @version2beta Mongo runs in RAM. the more the merrier.
@lordlobo @version2beta And if I wanted to play with Mongo sharding ad mongo router, I'd have to spin up multiple VMs on a box w/lots of RAM
@version2beta no offense, but 600k is nothing to mongo. I threw 850k-ish records in mongo on my laptop & it used a gig more RAM.
@version2beta the mongo data set discussed last night is 150 million documents.
@version2beta @lordlobo it's just like saying "why would you ever need more than 640k of RAM?" eventually someone will need more.

Hello from Minneapolis.
@dolanpatrick I've got a MBP but if I'm going to keep flying, I will get an11" Macbook Air.
In Austin. It's... Warm?
Weather is beautiful in Austin :-)
@dolanpatrick oh, definitely. The SSD is a huge performance gain.
@dolanpatrick Max it out (they sell returbs configured that way) and it does fine, even driving the Cinema displays or playing games.
@steveklabnik Skrillex's playing the reggae festival? #ikeed #thatdbeawesome.
@steveklabnik What are you doing before Ignite?
RT @rentisdue: HOW IS YOUR SPENDING GOIN
The back of this TV has a lot going on. 
Google Maps doesn't know where I am. I don't know where I am either, Google Maps.
@chirpah Nope, I'm in downtown Austin. It's about 20 miles off..
@myfreeweb curious, right? Like, what happens if I connect to that and nmap it.. Is there a PC in there? There's a LAN port too.
@steveklabnik gotcha.
Hanging out at Austin Ignite at # before it was cool.

Just saw the word "inbox" upside-down and suddenly understood why Xobni was named that.
RT @steveklabnik: Wow. @rsim's talk at Ignite totally killed it. If I don't see a better talk, it'll have been a good RailsConf.
@deadprogram's Ignite RailsConf talk was very inspiring. Kids Code Camp ftw.

@happymrdave The other Hilton. It stopped. @BlatzLiquor: They were agreeing a lot and moving the furniture around for about 4 minutes.
Wow. iPhoto is not impressing me. It's kind of a piece of crap.
Good morning, #RailsConf
@version2beta I'm at RailsConf in Austin. @steveklabnik is here but @ashedryden is not :(
@maryloulenhart trying to get @steveklabnik 's Ignite talk off my phone in full length & full quality
@svenfuchs omg hai
@svenfuchs we must do our secret handshake from @MadisonRuby later. Josh & I couldn't remember it last night.
RT @steveklabnik: Austin and AirBnB are awesome. I'm staying in a geodesic dome in someone's backyard here at #railsconf.
OH: Who's DHH? He's a developer, an author, and a space marine.
@jasonbot2000 
@DDysart yes. Questions are lame, too.
@jasonbot2000 it wouldn't stop a video import that I was trying to cancel. Lack of responding to user = suck. I had places to be.
RT @svenfuchs: "stay hippie" is a tagline I can totally identify with. @dhh #railsconf
Dear Apple: if I'm messaging someone then give me the ability to call or FaceTime them from right there.
Sprint's 3G is pretty good in this conference center. Guessing most people are on iPhones on AT&T.

Lessons learned so far: smaller bag, MBA or an iPad to take notes on. #RailsConf

Headed to the Bat Bar to see bats. Is batman there?
Also, related: Pretty sure that @cheshster would love the Bat Bar, at least the concept of it.
@steveklabnik @ashedryden Doh. Vimeo's upload is a max 500mb. I guess I'll have to edit it to a small size. I can't trim it any shorter.
@ashedryden @steveklabnik good idea. On it.

@kevinalford That's the one that was right behind our restaurant the first day; haven't checked it out.
So today was pretty awesome, and it is not even over yet!
@thebestsophist glad you enjoyed it. I always had a great time there. The fact that they've got roots in the local music scene is awesome.
@steveklabnik where'd all the cool kids go?
RT @ashedryden: OH: We party hard. Clearly. So hard that we need hot dogs.
@bryanl Plus, if you're chaining scopes and at some point it is returning a different type of object to the next, Law of Demeter violation.

@happymrdave you in the same room now for Josh's Travis talk?
@happymrdave my bag is in the lightning talks for me (left it in there somewhere, don't tell the TSA that it was out of my sight..)
Zomg. 
@happymrdave sorry, was talking to the @travisci guys.
Hey #RailsConf, I'm looking for the guy that gave the first lightning talk on NSRails. Can someone introduce us? I'm in the lobby. Thanks!
I like turtles.

@lrdesign I'm headed over there now, but according to my phone it's only a 1 minute walk for me. No rush.
How about "no"  and I go get the epub free here? 
@lightcap Funny thing, I'm only 1 degree of separation from Justin Vernon through 2 different people. cc @wndxlori @jremsikjr
I just saw a crazy guy block an off ramp and demand ten cents for passage. Stay weird, Austin.
@lrdesign sorry, apparently they've moved and I walked to the wrong place. No idea where I'm headed now.
GAH. This isn't the Vegan Yacht. I'm I the wrong place.
@lrdesign yeah agreed. Sorry.
Thanks for being useless, Yelp.
#RailsConf is OVER. #Portlandia
@superbranch @BlatzLiquor Sadly that was not from the "MacGuyver Institute" which would have been far more awesome.

At least @jremsikjr is driving an Autobot.

I am.. Somewhere in LA
Stumbling in to your Airbnb accommodations with a key code from the owner is not unlike simply breaking into a place you've never been.
I should note that the tweet about feeling like we were breaking into our airbnb went out at 2am, which is part of why it felt that way.
I think I forgot a pretty important piece of my camera when packing for LA. Oh well, I guess I'll be shooting pictures/video with my IPhone.
Walking to Farmhouse Conf.
Technically in Hollywood. Land of barbed wire fences. 
Thanks again to @bluebox for helping us get to attend Farmhouse Conf.
@tronathan you can install a hybrid epaper/LCD screen in certain net books.

@rbxbx thank you, sir. It was awesome having you.
@rbxbx I'll start putting together an "epic" bike ride with beer stops.

@peggysmith56 pretty fun trip so far! :) @ashedryden
You can get valet parking at the Rite Aid pharmacy here. Crazy.

@listrophy the sad truth is that it is a crapshoot as to what will fit and what you'll like. Typically, you need to ride it.

Good thing we got to the airport early. Apparently AirTran turned off the check-in kiosks and there are no agents :(
@tashitachog hehe, watching her entertain these kids now.
Hey @AirTran, we're at LAX and there's no one at your counters. The check-in kiosks don't work. We don't want to miss out flight. Help?
@ashedryden yeah, I saw that. cc @airtran
@CoderTrader I called; they can't help me or contact the people here at LAX. Total fail, @airtran.
Through TSA. On our way.. Now we just wait several hours for our flight.
The tiredness got me.
@superbranch don't forget to feed the trolls.
So I guess they don't actually play Brian Eno's Music for Airports in airports.
@jasonbot2000 I am. 11pm flight out gets me to MKE by 5am. You in the office tomorrow?

@Strabd Thanks though :)

@joshdean @alterracoffee Pretty sure several startups in Milwaukee were launched out of Alterra cafes with free wifi. Sad to see that go.
@heygabe @joshdean In MKE, I picked apartments that lots of people could hang out &amp; cowork at. "Code &amp; coffee salons" may make a comeback.
@joshdean sounds like a plan.
@Strabd the former if there is no else. The last if it makes sense; that is probably the clearest intent.
@Strabd @leshill if you're in Rails, consider putting the logged_in? check in a before_filter, :only =&gt; that action.
@Strabd @leshill Logged in considerations are usually not a part of the action's own responsibility
@mbleigh I'm with you. I feel more productive in Ruby and Rails, but I feel like that's a bias due to my experience.
@leshill @Strabd Devise has a class macro to add authentication checks to controllers, right? I'm forgetting the name.
@veganstraightedge I'm a &lt;customer name&gt; too!
@Strabd @leshill I recommend you check out some good open source Rails-based projects on Github to see how people are doing authentication.
My brain is swimming around in some sort of aether. Waves of it are washing around my skull. Yeah, my cold isn't going away today..
@Strabd @leshill Omniauth integrates well with Devise, and there's docs on their respective Github wikis.
@Strabd I can only recommend that you check out the Devise wiki. Diaspora is a great project but I don't recommend going off their source.

I love when our crappy wifi goes down.
I wonder if someone will call me out on my lack of tact for complaining about wifi. "just think of all the hard work your wifi does for you"
@whazzmaster wow. That's ridiculous.
@whazzmaster If you can't solve a problem in 10K LoC or less, something is wrong. Too much scope, too little abstraction, not DRY, etc.
@whazzmaster That's not including frameworks or libraries; those get you to the abstraction level where you can reasonably solve the problem
@whazzmaster Well, that's when you're using the wrong language, in my humble opinion. We, the human race, are beyond string bullshit.
@whazzmaster it isn't C++ itself, it's the projects it breeds.
@whazzmaster for example: You can't hold 10 million LOC all in your head. You spend more lines on the language than you do on the problem.
@whazzmaster to build a project that big, you need many more programmers than a team can have &amp; maintain culture / standards.
@whazzmaster &amp; finally, you get faddish styles rather than idiomatic code.

@SeanTAllen yes, I have the subscription, but trying to prioritize the really good stuff right now.
I wish I could fork my instance and run multiple copies of myself to go learn new things, then merge that experience back in. Oh well.
@CoderTrader Even if it's a decade-long project, maybe we should start coding this ;)
@CoderTrader drop-ship pallets of Mythical Man-Month to such managers, ask them if they finished it yet, since you gave them so many copies.
My ability to focus is waning. Wish I didn't get so tired do early. Then again, I have been fighting a cold all week.
@whazzmaster great! I'll get right on inventing a transporter.
@tomhenrich friend me on goodreads, and stuff.
@tomhenrich aHA
@whazzmaster exactly. even if it's an energy&lt;=&gt;matter issue, just keep making energy by destroying matter.
@tomhenrich doing a bit of housekeeping on there. It's a lot of work to keep every book I've read / am reading up to date, easier to batch
@lindseybieda awesome!
I don't know whether to be more sad when people think I'm clueless, or more sad when they think I'm smart.
@CoderTrader yeah, debating it. I only have so much time on the weekend, time that I can claim for myself.

I guess cleaning means I can get caught up on podcasts, though.

Thinking about building up a rat rod truck as an EV.  how cool would that be? cc @mkemakerspace @jasonbot2000 @gl33p
@mkemakerspace @jasonbot2000 @gl33p @drezdn although my older idea was to convert the S10 to EV &amp; build as a prerunner 
@ashedryden @tomhenrich I like Luna bars. Disregard the "for women" branding, they're easier to eat. Clif Bars are great, but dense.

@gl33p even just a simple battery pack, generator, and solar panel tonneau cover (which I know wouldn't get a full charge, but neat to have)
@gl33p it helps that the S10 is already lightweight from the factory. If I wanted a 40 mile range, only a small battery pack.
@gl33p sealed gel cells, I imagine. haven't really run the numbers, and I don't know what voltage or electric motor I'd be running, either.
@gl33p the other temptation is to get a off-the-shelf VW conversion kit to turn a Microbus into an EV. But it would get eaten by rust here.
@rylnd "You look like you're fighting dragons. From the future"
@gl33p yeah, just expensive. Although the whole conversion is relatively cheap, I guess. I was seeing some kits as low as $1600 w/o batt's
@gl33p also worthwhile for a little more money are regen braking and power steering.

@3liza middle of hair dyeing process question: leave dye in for a half hour, rinse with white vinegar, then wash hair normally?
@ashedryden :-)
@3liza special effects, guessing instructions are similar. We may fall asleep soon, tho, so may have to cut wait time at half hour.
@3liza gotcha.
Never before has the technique for rinsing ones hair been so analyzed in this house.
So @ashedryden's hair turned out pretty awesome. Pics later.
@3liza and just wash it until the dye stops coming visibly out?
@3liza ah. Too late for the no shampoo. Oh well.
@3liza no bleach, this was over normal hair.

@jregan unfortunately the main issue with my two rides is one is fixed and the other is SS ;)

Amazed at how great the content was in MAKE Magazine vol 1.
I subscribed to the 1st year of MAKE when it came out, amazing amount of content packed into each issue. I've read them all dozens of times.
Looking for a cheap, wheeled kid's toy to build a robot out of, inspired by  from the 1st issue of MAKE Magazine.
Might go with this:  since the RumbleBots and their clones cost around $15 on Amazon. Pretty cheap mobile robot platform
For those playing along at home, the robot toy I chose to buy &amp; hack into a little personal robot is the Roborover: 
#robotproject: It will get an Arduino, Motorshield, a Raspberry Pi for higher-level AI &amp; speech (when I can get one), IR, sonar, camera,wifi
If the Raspberry Pi proves difficult to get ahold of, I might go with a cheap Android phone &amp; this board: 
@ashedryden is humming the Rocky montage music while she teaches @tafferinspace to not be dumb. "1 plus 1, equals 2.."
@rbxbx Thinking of making it run Ruby, assuming I can find a Raspberry Pi :D
@rbxbx Or some sort of lightweight Scheme that I can write the AI in.
@rbxbx I guess "lightweight" and "Scheme" are kind of redundant. #redundantredundant
If you'd like to try out robotics with an Android phone, check out 
@rbxbx right. Other than Android, which might benefit from Clojure.. hmm..
@rbxbx Although the benefit of running the Raspberry PI would be that it might be able to run ROS (the robot OS) 
@rbxbx Looks like it should be supported:  The robot I bought is probably too small to carry a netbook :/
Gardening.

Garden progress. Tomatoes, green peppers, green bean and cucumbers. 
@listrophy fffuuuuu

Happy with the garden progress today.
@rbxbx through commanding other robots, clearly.
@rbxbx progress in embedded/low-power boards like Raspberry Pi means that I can upgrade the "brains" periodically &amp; get more performance.
So today was pretty awesome.. now to clean the house D:
@sfradkin do you have any advice for clearing area that's overgrown w/ grass/weeds? I need a Rototiller ;) but think I'll dig it out w/spade

@jasonbot2000 I'm going to get the Arduino and motor controller working first, but if you don't mind ;) When do you want to do lunch?
@jasonbot2000 I'll probably skip the USB drive, HTML5 browser editor, etc. and opt for a wifi connection, SSH, &amp; connect the USB to Arduino
@jasonbot2000 &amp; if the Beaglebone isn't powerful enough for what I want to do with OpenCV, I guess I can always get a Beagleboard xM.
@jasonbot2000 This guy did some nice work with the original Beagleboard, OpenCV and a Playstation Eye webcam: 
Among all the other things I did this morning, I cleaned off a workbench in our basement to work on robots. Gotta tell downstairs neighbors.
Sparkfun parts ordered. Now the waiting begins! :D
@jasonbot2000 I'm planning to use this  and modify it with some low-level survival behaviors on the Arduino. We'll see.
@jasonbot2000 next week I start a new project over by the UW, but in two weeks time I should know my schedule and be able to meet you, yeah.
@jasonbot2000 I could've used that when I built the Internet Coffee Pot.. probably still could if I ever work on that again..
@jasonbot2000 it was a coffeepot that recorded last brew time, temperature to a web app (thru a pc host, but had planned Ethernet shield)
@jasonbot2000 eventually I wanted it to be able to brew a pot on demand w/ automated grinder, water, etc.

@lindseybieda I want to be having this conversation.
@lindseybieda stuck in an up-north vacation spot with @ashedryden's family. They're not quite having a conversation about time dilation...
@RyanK @ajbombers @ashedryden we're not there! Next time!
@lindseybieda I don't think I could speak up over the rest of them to do so. About all I get in is smiling and nodding.
@ashedryden @lindseybieda you've been gone for, like, an hour. Where are you?
@lindseybieda I'm just here to be eye candy, act polite, and carry things.
@sfradkin we were joking that you can make your own with a happy hacking keyboard, a Raspberry Pi velcroed to it, and a Sony 3D HUD.

@myfreeweb I think we've found that the micro has too little RAM for doing Clojure dev.
@myfreeweb  It's replacing a local dev env on a laptop, essentially, but benefit is can access from anywhere.
@twopoint718 yep. Engelbart's Violin. We're developers, craftsmen. We need specialized hardware &amp; software. (Derived from consumer stuff.)
@twopoint718 But particularly, it's not just that it has to be specialized. It's not that we use special gold-plated keyboards.
@twopoint718 The part that is different in the developer's needs is that the system has to be completely customizable.
@twopoint718 This is the opposite of what most consumers want, which is predictable behavior.
@twopoint718 That's why my little counter to the Engelbart's Violin essay is that there are: Happy Hacking and Kinesis keyboards. Just $$$.
@twopoint718 Sure, they're still based on QWERTY keyboards which are based on typewriters, etc. Master carpenters still use a hammer.
@mathiasx @twopoint718 Master carpenters just have specialized hammers for each task. Some don't resemble anything a weekend warrior buys.
@twopoint718 They do exist, just not widely used: chording keyboards, foot pedals, jog wheels, 3D pointing mice, brainwave gaming headsets.
@twopoint718 Don't get me wrong, I am not arguing against that essay and believe it probably would be better if we had hardware for dev's.
@twopoint718 But as it stands, Apple makes the best laptops for development, already somewhat 'prosumer' in its pricing.
@twopoint718 I'm totally on board for specialized machines that let us do our jobs better, tho. And make it less likely we'll get RSI, etc.
@twopoint718 I just can't think of any company that is making a more powerful portable dev machine. (Thanks to Intel CPUs, mostly.)
@twopoint718 not really. maybe better GPUs. RAM &amp; CPUs are top-of-the-line in MBAs and MBPs. Plus, I can't carry a 10-16 pound laptop.
@twopoint718 If we include desktops, @JaymesWaters's Retina MBP is nearly as powerful as current low-end Mac Pro desktops in Geekbench score

@Strabd if you're going PC, I guess it really depends if you want speed or not, and then whether you want to haul around 8+ lbs of laptop.

@jasonbot2000 on thousands of machines lie half-completed Lisps. Once you start learning about it, you'll probably try to build one, too.

@tashitachog @matt_wheel @sfradkin RISC is good...
@sfradkin @tashitachog @matt_wheel actually, I'm all about designing CPUs that use richer instruction sets right now, but besides the point.
@sfradkin @tashitachog @matt_wheel 
Why am I reading an ancient CS paper, a CS textbook, &amp; a modern Clojure book all at the same time? (or at least flitting through them): ADD.
@lightcap I wouldn't know. I'm not interested &amp; don't pay for cable TV.
@TrevorBramble Someone should write a nice Mac GUI frontend, but maintain the speed &amp; keyboard nav. Oh, &amp; render HTML emails with Webkit.
I don't have any headphones currently to blast music and maintain the weird loud-music-focus-bubble I had before. Rapidly falling asleep.
@listrophy that's why you gotta double fist coffee and beer. For fine-tuning.
My browser's top tabs are just Github, rvm.io, and Netflix. I've forgotten how real people use the internet.
@southpolesteve Oh, I've got headphones. Just not here right now.

@sfradkin ermagherd imma nerd.
Stupid Google Maps. Doesn't update for transit detours or delays. (Like te Farmer's Market.) Which makes it entirely useless.
All of these tech events being indoors doesn't jive with the fact that I want to spend my free time outdoors, enjoying the weather, reading.
@trodrigues well, looks like the event I'm at today has a courtyard with cafe tables that I can take over!
@trodrigues also, dude, I need to scheme so that I can come hang out and hack over there.
@trodrigues yeah. Maybe if I end up speaking over there at a conference.
@KeVroN whereyat
Badmouthing other groups at a BarCamp-style event is the best way to turn off outsiders. Example: Ruby users bash PHP &amp; PHP users bash Ruby.
Also, if you're going to disrespect what I'm passionate about, I'm going to walk away from your conversation. I don't owe you that respect.
RT @trodrigues: @mathiasx I do the same these days. a bit of bashing among friends is one thing but this nerd rage you see at some event ...
@j3 google calendar office hours feature doesn't cut it? I haven't used it, TBH.

@hcatlin I love when they move off and to the right, then I try to zoom to see it, and it moves farther off the screen. LOVE IT.

Tired of this :/
Wishing I had a lighter laptop (like a Macbook Air) for this trip. Walked a couple miles with my laptop bag today &amp; really feeling the pain.
@CoderTrader I've got shoulder issues. It's not the quality of the bag, its the weight of the load. And I'll be travelling to PGH next wk.
@CoderTrader thanks though

@sindresorhus not sure if that all falls on the shoulders of TodoMVC to demonstrate.
@sindresorhus just would like to see more idiomatic JS MVC code demonstrated; every tutorial and book does things differently at this point.
@sindresorhus @petermichaux err, I think that came off wrong. Not looking for stronger use of MVC pattern.
@sindresorhus @petermichaux  I meant that even in one framework like Backbone, different resources show 5 different ways to do something.
@sindresorhus @petermichaux so "idiomatic" in the sense of everyone doing these client side JS apps agreeing on how to do something.
@sindresorhus @petermichaux I'm used to Rails; people build many different types of apps, but we tend to agree on what is idiomatic.
@sindresorhus @petermichaux that said, I found Ember to be confusing and poorly documented when used on a project this spring.
@sindresorhus @petermichaux good to hear :) btw, thank you for your work. It's making the JS MVC world more approachable.
@sindresorhus on Ember (and not to just rant) I still feel like it is geared only for list-of-stuff apps. Maybe I can whip up an example.
@sindresorhus yeah, I know the @travisci guys are using it. Need to figure out a way to spend some time pairing with them on Travis :)

@krainboltgreene package systems are great, because those libs are only a command away. But outdated "stable" versions in pkg repos sucks.
@krainboltgreene I'm convinced that a pkg system like Debian and Ubuntu's can't stay current with modern open source projects.
@krainboltgreene Homebrew's github-based system is better. But not sure if any linux distros use a similar system.
@krainboltgreene maybe if it wasn't compiled in, but available as a compilable gem?
@krainboltgreene IMHO as many external (not written by Ruby-core) libraries as possible should be gems. Obvsly the language itself has req's
@krainboltgreene smaller core language and smaller standard lib = better, IMHO.

Squeak is all kinds of awesome. Kind of blowing my mind.
@davestrock awesome! thinking that the RaspPi just made it really cheap to equip a lab for classes. (&amp; a bit of work to flash the SD cards)

@davestrock with some sort of durable case &amp; a set of cables, could become something they keep in bookbag, take to-from school.
I needed a powered USB hub for the Raspberry Pi, so I got one of these:  Whovian fans take note :)
@davestrock this is where the toy companies could step up -- they're used to building cheap electronics into quarter-inch plastic for kids.
@davestrock I don't think a 3D printed case would be durable enough on the flat sides. Yes, ABS is tough, but flat pieces aren't crush-proof
@davestrock This looks promising:  but I feel like it needs a silicone skin like a USB key.
@davestrock or an otterbox (if those were cheap..)
Hey @plural, @raster what are you using for Raspberry Pi cases? Are they durable enough for kids to toss around in a bookbag? cc @davestrock
@davestrock Yeah, I feel bad that I haven't followed through yet with setting up a program at our community center to teach kids programming
@davestrock this is a laser-cut-a-design one-at-a-time place, and it's $12.50 + S&amp;H. At volume at a maker space, it should be way cheaper.
@davestrock also I'd design the case to enclose the SD card do that it is less likely to snap off.

@tundal45 not necessarily. It's more about relaxing and disconnecting.

Anyone using Redis to cache ActiveModel objects? Are you using a gem?
@whazzmaster not what I need, and you don't typically serialize models to queues, just active record IDs to look up record later.
@whazzmaster   basic idea is to cache model until it changes, which cuts down on the number of API calls between web app requests.
OH: InfoQ is basically Clojure TV at this point..
@blissdev we do Clojure work, server side stuff serving web apps or APIs, usually. ClojureScript is for building rich client apps.
@blissdev It's the new hotness. And it's a Lisp, so that's a huge plus.

@ashedryden it's possible to use Monte Carlo on your estimates against real time taken and get a degree of certainty for future estimates.
@ashedryden usually stories have tracking around them and their own fine grain estimates in tracker software. Can also use git.
@ashedryden and then you can adjust future new estimates against historically being wrong on the granular estimates.

Anyone know if they play bike polo in Madison?
@JimLindForPope it's definitely popular in MKE &amp; there's pick-up matches there. I've never seen someone on a polo bike here in Madison.

So one day after getting a Thunderbolt display and it no longer turns on. Great product, Apple.
re: Thunderbolt display: last night the MBA attached to it was put to sleep, &amp; now the TB display doesn't wake up. Apparently a known issue.
Probably going to return the Thunderbolt display, because it's concreted my belief that Thunderbolt is a piece of shit.
It's a good thing I bought this very-expensive boat anchor of a monitor that won't turn on though. Thanks, Apple!
@Matt_Wheel no, it's supposed to come back, but it was powered off all day, so the "wait 5 minutes" well elapsed.
@Matt_Wheel but if people are returning them when they have this issue, and I just got a refurb... This is probably one of the bad ones &gt;.&lt;
@Matt_Wheel yeah, so looking forward to schlepping a 35+lb monitor on the bus to the apple store.

@drezdn that's a neat idea. I've been looking into lots of different ways to finish pedals lately...
@drezdn etching + transparent paint glazes is what I want to try on a pedal next. Etching seems cool.
@drezdn I've only done Rustoleum hammer finish and some inkjet decals with a thick clear coat.
@drezdn general idea is that big blocks of etched area (image background) are black, so paint on a masked off area with transparent color.
@drezdn I think the paint glazes would look really cool on top of a textured block or a pattern, beyond just solid black blocks.
@drezdn re:inkjet decals: they're not great. I would rather figure out how to screen print on labels.

@alindeman it doesn't matter, since I'm gonna bootstrap it in itself eventually, and because I could alway use something like bison instead.

@alindeman It's a book about building a VM where the instruction set is a purely functional lisp variant, actually: 
@alindeman implementation is language agnostic, which is cool, since I don't have to puzzle through old academic Pascal or Fortran :p
@alindeman note that the idea to re-do it in Bison would imply a compiled language. I think I'd much rather go the VM route for now.

@wesgarrison Probably try to procure 4 pallets and just screw it all together. We've got corrugated plastic in the garage for a lid.
@wesgarrison well, it'll be frozen solid for the winter. and really, the other bin is full, so in spring I need to dig that out and rebuild.
@wesgarrison oh, I'd probably just use the wood from the pallets. Not 4' x 4'. More like the size of a garage bin like you were saying.
@wesgarrison just aware that it doesn't need to be airtight, but can't let stuff be flying around the yard all winter either.

@mathiasx @rbxbx I'll, uhh, use a looper/delay pedal to make that possible.
Sgt. Pepper's is still such a good album. An amazing achievement in songwriting and sonic palettes for western music. There I've said enough
lol, Aerosmith is the villain band in this movie.
I've graduated up to putting 3 different kinds of hot sauce in my V8 to make my own spicy V8.. hoping it busts this cold out of my face.
@rbxbx actually I do think a melodica is on the list for instruments to pick up soon. Too much fun! + crazy noise w/ contact mic.

@TrevorBramble Dr. Scientist Mini-RRR. Mine looks like this: 
@TrevorBramble that demo video is just guitar -&gt; pedal -&gt; amp. Current opinion online is to put it before OD/fuzz for distorted trails.
@TrevorBramble I'll see what I can come up with for a demo video of my setup.
@TrevorBramble also now that I've watched a few, I think this is a better demo: 
@TrevorBramble let me know if you ever have guitar pedal questions or want to know how to get a sound. I go through.. a lot of them.
@TrevorBramble heh, it sounds like you want to be on  Are you thinking fuzz pedal or just overdrive?
@TrevorBramble  Gritty, dark-voice overdrive can get thick and textured without getting into fuzz territory.
@TrevorBramble demo video uploading to youtube. It's a rough cut with sniffling (I'm sick) but it demos the sound a little.
@krainboltgreene I think they're closer to MVVM and iOS's MVC than Rails MVC.
All good intentions.. lead to watching cat videos on Youtube. Scientists are not yet sure why.
Waiting for a video to process on youtube is the same as watching paint dry. Or watching a pot until it boils.
@TrevorBramble here's what I put together: 
@TrevorBramble that's a Fuzzhugger Algal Bloom. Great note definition in chords, and keeps the low-end 
@TrevorBramble err, actually, I guess at 3:30 it's the EQD Hoof: 
@TrevorBramble there's fuzzes with even more low-end and heaviness, but those are pretty good!
@TrevorBramble I like to things to sound dark and heavy. I avoid treble-y icepicks. So that's led me to a lot of my gear.

Can anyone recommend a (cheap-to-free) iOS app for recording audio? I want to do field recordings, recording concerts, etc., not voice memos
@krainboltgreene I have a mic, I need the software.
@edcetera seems to be a common suggestion. I wouldn't mind using it.
@sixohsix @edcetera also seeing a lot of blogs saying just go with free Griffin iTalk app.
@edcetera @sixohsix I had downloaded quickvoice at some point to record meetings. It seems to have the same features as iTalk.
@krainboltgreene I should say, I just need press-to-record and the ability to transfer files. No editing or effects or anything.

Anyone writing commandline apps in Ruby with puts/gets-style input/output with the user? How are you testing that interaction?
@JoelMcCracken pretty sure they don't do gets, they just send an array into a guess method. I've got a constraint that prevents that method.
@JoelMcCracken Already have that as StringIO buffers, yeah. Issue is that the script kicks off &amp; never waits for my tests to send input.
@wilkieii can't seem to get stdin as a StringIO to work.
@wilkieii @joelMcCracken 
@wilkieii @JoelMcCracken I should've added to all this that I'm trying to do a BDD "play the whole game" rather than unit tests (which work)
@wilkieii @JoelMcCracken Good catch. Brain flipped it &gt;.&lt;
@wilkieii The test is actually failing at 'I should be prompted for the answer to the first question' b/c it's already run with nil inputs.
@mathiasx @wilkieii basically like someone held down the enter key before the test even got to the point of trying to send input
@mathiasx @wilkieii I might just have to move the game loop up out of the class and into bin/ script.. but will have to massively refactor
@whiskycraig we're all out D: D: 
@jonsmock yes! Thank you! I was looking for stdin/stdout libs that had a test mode (which was the wrong abstraction) This is way better!
@jonsmock It's a game, and I want to test playing it. But yes, my coworker @begriffs was pointing out that I was probably chasing perfection
@jonsmock also if the REPL in it wasn't stateful, it'd be a lot easier to test, you'd just send input as a message &amp; expect returned output.

@browrp note the date. I wasn't aware of other things back then. I've learned a lot since &amp; there's been a lot of changes in the Rails world
If my iPhone used to sync with my MBP, but I want it to sync with new MBA, iTunes only deletes music, books, etc not apps, pics &amp; contacts?
@browrp honestly, I haven't used MongoDB a ton since. Postgres covers 90% of our projects' DB needs.

@kerrizor I've had this in the back of my mind for awhile &amp; have discussed it with folks. Big challenge is setting up projects for success.
@imjoshdean mine's warning me that it is gonna delete some stuff, but I don't want it to wipe. I don't want to lose my data :(
Is Vine basically Instagram for videos? Plus.. animated GIF stuff?
@jmbroad Mega Drive - Futurescapes was a good recommendation. Sadly, it's not in Rdio (yet!)
It's pretty crazy to be in Campfire talking to @listrophy while he's flying in an airplane!
@kerrizor yes. Expectation management plays a huge part, though.
I think I finally grokked Calibre, have it set up to convert ebooks to work on my iPhone, and have it sending books to iTunes. Pretty slick.
So @devn had a pretty good idea the other night, which is that I should probably spend some time learning Haskell.

Weird bug where attempting to call 'click_on "Submit"' in a capybara + poltergeist step returns 'fail' and I give up.
@corbenfrost nothing complicated. Switched to Calibre; it can treat iTunes as a device to sync books to. Then iBooks puts it on my iPhone.

@rbxbx Some of this is tools, some of this is reliability (helped by practices), some of this is the wrong abstractions, some is langs used.

@timocratic And by analytics, I don't mean website traffic / typical devops analytics. Real world sensor data is a better term, maybe.
@timocratic that'd be an interesting way to go. I've never run it.
@timocratic Any idea if I can run HBase (or any option) on a phone (Android most likely) and sync the data up with a server? That'd be cool.
@jmbroad @timocratic Yeah, I was considering it, but it seems like the bindings for planned language (Clojure) are old and unmaintained.

I guess I should be honored that @hipsterhacker favorited one of my tweets.
@antifuchs this looks really interesting. Going to read up. Thank you!
@antifuchs Yeah. I don't know of a solution is that doesn't eventually require big EC2 instances that cost a lot. Could prune data, I guess.

@gf3 why are they named like that, or why am I making a bookmarklet? :)
@gf3 This doesn't:  javascript:window.location=%22
@gf3 Which I'm guessing is due to the name of the field
@gf3 Funny thing is, I've used (more or less) the same bookmarklet code to pre fill things like our private HN instance, for years.
@gf3 Err, and I got the article[url] part wrong in the tweet, but right in the bookmarklet
@gf3 Err, got it wrong there because I changed the field name to make the code fit. But I've also tried it with escaped square brackets.

@ryanbigg @ashedryden Weird. I'll let you know if I find something similar; it's cool data to have.
@gf3 True. I'm on Rails 4.0 with decent exposure and the StrongParametersStrategy, so I'm wondering if params is even making it to Model.new

@fragmad If you want to learn some Clojure &amp; understand how object-oriented programming works better, then @marick's 
@fragmad The truth is, I tend to have fun no matter which Lisp or which book I pick up. For me, I wish to learn context, history &amp; theory.
@marick I think that's Slender man.
The internet sure is good at distractions.
@fragmad Also, I did SICP in Racket, which is a great set of tools and a scheme-like language.

@trodrigues At this point I'm experimenting with weird flours and using both soy milk and almond milk together to make them better, tho :-)
@begriffs @ashedryden and at that, it merely warns you about duplicated style, it doesn't build a new de-duped solution

I started reading The Healthy Programmer. Digging it so far.
@gregtarnoff @octopress @jclermont does it give a source file?
This talk by @codefinger is a good introduction to his book. Change your habits, extend your life &amp; be smarter. 
Help Kenyan programmer @NjeriChelimo attend @hackerschool: 
@gregtarnoff @ejknapp @octopress @jclermont Sanity checking: you have a post layout?
@kevinrj  It's a static site, so while there's RSS/Atom, Google Analytics, Disqus comments, etc. it doesn't really do anything dynamic.
@kevinrj @octopress But I've thought about doing dynamic stuff on the clientside. Example: JS MVC blog that reads static JSON off the server
These cats will be the death of me. But they're so cute!
@kevinrj I don't really want comments or trackbacks on my blog. It assumes responsibility for the commenters' behavior on my part.
@JosefAssad What does that make vim the product of?
@kevinrj yeah. If anything, I'm against widgets like the Like button, which are probably a lot easier for non-programmers to grok and use.
@kevinrj It depends on motivations. I share my posts on Twitter. I don't need the world to read my blog since it only appeals a small group.
@octopress Well, it could be something other than a blog. It's just an idea at this point; &amp; I've been toying with a lot of JS MVC lately.
@kevinrj I blog for myself rather than to achieve a goal like selling a product or to be included in larger discussions. Again, motivations.
@kevinrj But I also rarely blog and have really not found a voice in it, despite attempts to write a couple different "series" of posts.
@octopress This mirrors the conversation I'm having with @kevinrj: I wouldn't be concerned with whether search engines can index my site.
@octopress there's an assumption that everything written on a blog should be read by as many people as possible. Not everyone has that goal.
@octopress I guess I'm out on the fringes of blogging culture. I want to write cool little hacks and toys on the web &amp; maybe blog about it.
@octopress mostly why I have so few posts lately. My blog doesn't exist to market my thoughts or convince others.
@octopress Again, motivations. I play guitar as a hobby, and it is a personal thing. I don't feel the need to market that music or share it.
The house is mopped \o/ #springcleaning
@octopress not to downplay those that do share their knowledge, experience and passions. Just saying, there are other reasons, too.
@octopress I've gotten jobs partially due to writing how-to posts; I know a full time Rails dev that got started by hacking on Octopress.
@octopress so not to discount those things.
Second pot of coffee is a reward for cleaning the house and cleaning out the litterbox.

@sarablackthorne @gregtarnoff Also, `rvm info` and throw it into a  ?
These cats are gonna drive me crazy until @ashedryden gets home.
@sarablackthorne @gregtarnoff try this: `rvm update` (wait for it to complete) then `rvm requirements`
@gregtarnoff @sarablackthorne Also you'll want to try to get ruby-1.9.3-p392 once you've updated rvm's list of ruby patch levels.
@gregtarnoff @sarablackthorne (it has some nice segfault fixes that were plaguing 1.9.3 for awhile)
@sarablackthorne @gregtarnoff it might just make sense to "rvm implode" at this point and install a fresh copy with instructions from rvm.io
@lindseybieda @ashedryden lol boids
@sarablackthorne @gregtarnoff it looks like they changed it to `rvm get stable`. I just did `rvm get stable` then `rvm reinstall 1.9.3`
Murray won't stop. cc @ashedryden @lindseybieda

A text-based adventure which replies to all of your commands with: "That program is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:"

@jasonbot2000 I have VMware too but already had the box for Virtualbox downloaded, and bandwidth is at a premium over the mifi.

@infinitebuffalo @steveklabnik Someone asked me recently "How much do you pay that meter to lock your bike to it?" to start an argument.
There were no kittens on my slides tonight and no one called me on it. SURPRISE THE KITTENS WERE YOU ALL ALONG.
For those of you playing along at home, here's my colorful slides from tonight's @Madrailers talk: 
Hmm. It looks like my presenter notes aren't getting hidden for some reason. Oh well. (They should be in the console.log)
@ashedryden @wilkieii it's new wave. you'll get it eventually.
@wilkieii @ashedryden try it in webkit for realz?
@wilkieii @ashedryden I honestly didn't test because it's like 2 parts homebrewed and 2 parts elven magic.
I did not expect that to happen to my slide deck in Firefox.. (you can't see the animated GIFs dancing in there) 
@wilkieii @ashedryden It's just HTML and a little JS/CSS presentation-layer :)
@wilkieii @ashedryden Input file: 
@squareleaf @whazzmaster There's also the idea of using vanilla JS instead of jQuery when jQuery is unnecessary, too: 
@squareleaf @whazzmaster And FWIW I almost always use document.createElement rather than the magical jQuery-didn't-find-it-better-create-it.

@micahjgates that's a great plan. I hadn't thought of getting a thrift store aluminum pot to complement the tiny cookset.

@micahjgates well, I've only got 30 (maybe 40) pounds of load that I can carry easily for 2 people's gear, so weight does come into play.

@thebestsophist sadly veg*n-friendly breakfast/brunch places are much fewer and much smaller in Madison :/ (Cue Brunch Village lines.)
@thebestsophist we could try to get a table at Willalby's on Willy. Old school diner, tiny staff, and the tastiest vegan French toast.
@thebestsophist (but they have meat and eggs and everything too)
The iPhone app store's Upgrades mini game is my favorite mini game. I always win.
@thebestsophist cool! We'll see you there! Ashe just reminded me that it is cash only, but the coop is nearby and has an ATM.

@antifuchs have fun :)
.@tafferinspace is happy.
@thebestsophist let me know if you have any issues finding it. It's hidden between Ha Long Bay restaurant and a tattoo parlor.
@thebestsophist no worries. We scored a table and will chill until you get here :)

@tomhenrich long bike rides are my way of finding mindless time to shuffle the pieces and analyze patterns.
Anyone know of an iPhone 4S bike stem mount that doesn't require a special case to use?
I'm also partial to a top-tube bag that has a clear window on the top for my iphone. Basically want my iphone there, not on bars.
My research led me to Banjo Brothers. I think this little bag will do the trick for holding my iPhone securely 
@lovelybicycle Suggestions for storing/organizing bike gear? Too many search results are "some industrial designer designed a bike hanger."
@thebestsophist it was good to see you guys again! @ashedryden
Grr. Frustration at not being able to ride my miles today. Dealing with issues.
@lovelybicycle yeah, if I just had a shelving solution for helmets, locks, lights, winter gear, bike camping gear… the list goes on and on.
@zedshaw your profile picture makes me think of "KNEEL BEFORE ZOD" s/ZOD/ZED/
Being angry at the world.
Early morning bike ride before it gets hot? yes please.
I rode 50 miles today. Got an earlier start than usual by leaving at 8:30AM. Lake Monona Loop to Cap City trail to SW Commuter path &amp; back.
The good news is that it felt good with no issues! :)
@plural nope! Mostly Control-P here. But I'll give it a go pairing this week &amp; see what we think. Thanks for the heads up!
Here's the Strava link for the stats-obsessed :D 
@Wendy_RM having some gears (new bike is on its way) will make these longer rides quicker and less fatiguing. Climbed a ton of hills.
@Wendy_RM also, thanks :)
@tundal45 @tyler_jennings cool! Glad you're out enjoying your new bike :)
@Matt_Wheel Southwest Commuter Path? That's all bike path. The Lake Monona Loop includes some riding on the road. 
@Matt_Wheel Or do you mean that little loop on the southwest end of my ride?
@Matt_Wheel that's all roads. 3/4 of it is busy county highway where you'd have to hug the edge.
@Matt_Wheel If you're looking for a nice bike path ride with this kind of distance, check out the Military Ridge Trail to Mt. Horeb.
@Matt_Wheel the ride to Mt. Horeb is all bike path. Note that it's got about 12 mi of (really nice to ride on) gravel rather than pavement.
@Matt_Wheel we can ride out there some time if you're curious to learn the route.
I am the bike lobby. Offering to help people learn a new bike route is totally totalitarian. #bigwheel
@Matt_Wheel no worries. I've been trying to explore as many paths as possible this summer, so let me know if you ever want to try a new path
@Matt_Wheel also the arboretum ride is good and relatively close to home.

@jregan any cool rides this weekend?
Om nom nom never stop eating.
@pathlesspedaled I'll report back in a month or so about how the Nomads have held up for me. They're going to see some gravel!
@jregan trying :) I need to start distributing shorter rides throughout week rather than commute Mon-Fri w/ one long weekend ride.
Waking up at 5:30AM when you don't want to is frustrating.
@jregan I think that's the ticket. I can always go the long way by riding around Lake Monona.
@superbranch our cats banging on the door earlier and earlier every day don't help. I'm also guessing its the exhaustion + nap of yesterday.

@Strabd and working with such talented, passionate people, my lack of passion feels apparent :(
@Wendy_RM cool! What's the financial arrangement with the pedicab company, if you don't mind me asking?
@Wendy_RM ( In MKE I was gonna do it, but drivers rented pedicabs per hour and weren't allowed to ask for tips / certain payment.)
@jmbroad haven't had the need or desire to make something with software for awhile, TBH.

@jregan @JoeSteve HHH?
Left my laptop in the office. So far the iPhone is pretty good for everything I need. Maybe it is the only "computer" I need at home?
@jregan @JoeSteve oh wow. I didn't know about this! I might have to figure out ways to start mixing bits of this into my rides west.
@jregan @JoeSteve on my next ride out to Mt. Horeb, I'm going to have to push myself to get out to Blue Mounds and tackle some hills.
@jregan @JoeSteve truth is, "my backyard" is horribly flat and I am way out of shape as far as climbing.
@jregan one of these days this summer, I'll join you for that ride :) Probably after spending the previous day riding from Madison, though!
@jregan yep! Just gotta keep riding until then. It'll be possible before I know it.

@JoeSteve @jregan this loop? 
Why is it that all the startup job ads wanted proven track records of shipping, when the founders likely have records of repeated failure?
@JoeSteve @jregan once I have gears (new bike being built), I'll probably give it a try.
@jregan @JoeSteve my only issue with some Madison routes that I've seen is that on non-race-days, these county hwy's can be dangerous.
@zgohr I feel like founders wear failure like a badge of honor.
@zgohr I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, it's just an interesting cultural trait. Developers fail at projects, too..
@zgohr But personal projects or open source projects that never go anywhere aren't as big of a deal as a legal entity (LLC, etc) failing.
I dunno, I guess I don't have anything new to say on startups. I just think it is all a weird world.
@harper @zaneshelby yeah, I can see that.
The first rule about startups is never say anything about startups on Twitter.

@davereid well, considering the food is already paid for and I don't know if I have a way to dispute it, versus paying the delivery driver …
Thanks @GrubHub. You guys are super helpful.
@Brock I suspect it's the restaurant getting slammed &amp; not realistically updating the wait times + clicking "out for delivery" right away :(
Complaining due to impatience, even when probably warranted, just makes you look bad. Lesson learned :/
@davereid yeah. Kinda eerily magical coincidence how quickly it showed up once I complained :/
Good thing I've got all these supplies for cleaning out wounds and bandaging up big scrapes from the last time I crashedu bike :(
@jregan :(
@jregan heh, I'm the king of caution right now. Crashing will do that to you.
Still feeling a little banged up today. Gotta get a bigger piece of gauze to bandage up my elbow :(
@jregan yup. And we're planning on Comet Cafe for dinner; should fix me up in no time!
Using an iPhone with polarized glasses is cool. Everything is a rainbow!

Afternoon "snack" is a tiny amount of leftover white rice, edamame, corn, red cabbage, and sriracha + sesame oil. Wishing I had to some Kale

@mikebloy It wouldn't fit out of the basement. Belonged to previous tenants, smelled, contained drug paraphernalia &amp; pr0n mags.That enough?
@svdodge I've been telling people how rad your @fyxation Quiver looks with 29er tires. Time for another photo shoot? :D

6:30pm and the insulation guys are just starting to work on our apartment. Starts with... Tearing up boards. &gt;.&lt;
Going to try to offset all the negative stress by planning a bike camping trip for this weekend.
Oh yeah, they're gonna work until 8PM &gt;.&gt; But I guess that's better than working until 8PM tomorrow night when @ashedryden &amp; I have plans?
@shadow rack and panniers is the plan so far.
@shadow I am planning on panniers on front, tent + sleeping pad on back, like this, though: 
@shadow seems stable in theory, but I don't actually know how I like it for my new bike (need to determine front load capabilities)
@shadow using a frame bag + backpack + other small bags has also become popular with the MTB packers 
So. Anyone want to ride from Madison to Blue Mounds Park with me to go camping this weekend?
Oh cool, they're using a sawzall!
@sigmavirus24 sawzall is a brand? Like Kleenex or (less so now) Xerox. Verbified.

eating all the grapes. it is my duty.
I rode 38.6 miles on my new bike tonight. Yay! 
Woke up with a headache again :(
I think the headaches might be a combination of lack of sleep (&lt;7 hours) and not eating enough to make up for yesterday's big ride (38miles)
Miles left for the week: 84. Blue Mounds Park + a ride out to enjoy scenery there might be the ticket to hit my goal.
Forgot my wallet on a day when I need it the most. Riding home, gah.
@ddux I track it with Fitbit. My goal might be low, but I get at least 50 oz. per day. Usually wake up in the night &amp; drink half a glass.
@ddux would love an references you can point at for hydration advice. Usually feel over-hydrated rather than dehydrated but could be.
@ddux Wow, advice online to drink one 16-20oz water bottle per hour. I drank 1 bottle on a 3 hour ride; but drank more water when I got home
@ddux yeah once I'm home, I try to hydrate with water, V8, beer as appropriate :)
Photographer friends: Recommend a nice DSLR that can do continuous video for greater than 30mins? I also gotta factor in gphoto2 support.
@southpolesteve @listrophy Seems to be an issue of FAT32 FS; only Canons seem to support streaming the video off the device &amp; into software
@southpolesteve @listrophy And even then, the Canon Producer software enforces that 30 minute limit.
Camera stuff is expensive. But I am told that it is worth it :-)
@southpolesteve @gregtarnoff I went with the Canon 6D after a short bout of waffling and agonizing about the decision.
@southpolesteve @gregtarnoff That said, I don't think we're gonna need the video capture to start, so it should be OK.

@shadow @obra yeah, it's a pretty good deal for a first gen device. I'm really tempted to scoop one up for developing my own wearable.
@shadow @obra "Coupled with the Recon SDK is an open web API available at launch" even better!
More on that Recon Jet cycling HUD / wearable display &amp; camera:  Runs Android with a dual core CPU? Nice.
@mathiasx the shot in the gallery of the display makes it look crisp, if cramped. But these first-gen wearables all have tiny displays.
@JoeSteve trying to catch up on Youtube on the highlights of stage 1 right now.
@shadow @obra Weird. Also their link to the checkout form is to an non-SSL form that tells you it is for dev only. Oops! Adding https worked
@obra @shadow I think I'm sold on this thing already. Just gonna find the extra money D:
@imjoshdean I feel like there should be a Milwaukee twitter account that replies to things like this with "Milwaukee loves you too!"
Wow, every single person online has a different idea about what any given type of workout should be. Kinda hard to gather any best practices
@whazzmaster cycling makes legs strong, doesn't really help the rest of the body. Need to balance my core / back / shoulders.
@whazzmaster and I've gotta be careful with stressing my right shoulder since it has an old injury and is only connective tissue now :(
@whazzmaster Oh, &amp; I've got a weight bench, free weights, barbell for squats etc, yoga ball &amp; punching bag courtesy downstairs neighbor :)
@whazzmaster feel free to email me if it doesn't fit in a tweet ;)
@whazzmaster thanks!!!
@whazzmaster this river is so legit it has its own museum.
@toolshedgirl I have to give them props for hitting all the points.
Dane County, Y U SO FLAT? 
Trying to find hills to climb in Madison on my bike in a 10 mile radius. Failing.
I guess that rules out going for a short (15 miles max) ride with intensity from hill climbs for today. Oh well.
Block party on my block. @BillBlondeau and @Matt_Wheel should get over here; one of Ellie's bands is playing 
@Carols10cents pretty sure the drivers in Pittsburgh don't want me riding my bike in Pittsburgh.
Lol, the band is playing the theme song to The Jeffersons as a tribute to the east side of Madison b
@BillBlondeau @Matt_Wheel did I mention there's beer? Eh? Eh? #bribery lol
I think I live on the coolest block in Madison. :-)
Drum circle rain. 
@blissdev @rohdesign I can't get into any of the frames they offer right now :(
@Matt_Wheel Yeah, I usually add this additional (useless) little triangle to my rides around the lake b/c it's a hill 
@heygabe jelly of your sun porch.
@qrush nice!
@qrush The "Star Wars - SUCKS" cartridge is the best.
Twilio tshirt reactions: "that's a cool shirt! What band is that?"
@fyxation you guys gonna have more blue Sessions for sale? I have a buddy that wants blue tires and yours are the only I'm recommending ;)
@jregan Yep! No good pics of it yet, but my bike shop should be posting it their Flickr soon &amp; I'll link it.
@jregan already 70 miles on it. Gotta get about 65 more this weekend.. so short ride tonight and long ride tomorrow.
@Matt_Wheel @BillBlondeau no worries! I didn't think about the block party until it happened, or I would have invited you both beforehand.
@jregan broken braze-on, sucks :( You got a warranty on that frame that you can get it fixed under?
I'm gonna go ride my bike now.
@jregan thanks! Totally digging it.
Giant wasp is not how I wanted to start my shower.
Even worse when you can no longer find the giant wasp, but you know it is in here.
@jregan snapped some pics on the way back in: 
@jregan from the side: 
@jregan those last two tweets shoulda been CC @svdodge @chrisgauger too. Doh.
Making a lentil &amp; bulgur wheat dish that I found on a bike camping blog. But I'm making it in my real kitchen w/ fresh kale from our garden.
That's *not* an intuitive place to put Bicycle Licenses in your licensing and permitting portal, City of Madison. 
@jregan @svdodge @chrisgauger Still waiting on a front rando-style rack in black, the Luxos U headlamp, and I'm still adjusting the saddle.
@jregan I stole the bell idea from @svdodge. Related: some wknd I'll have to get to MKE &amp; we can ride + do a photoshoot of our bikes!

Getting a late start to riding, but that's ok! Blue Mounds Park, here I come!
Rolling into Verona to eat a quick second breakfast in their nice pavilion's shade.
Climbing the hill into Blue Mounds Park in my easiest gear (1:1 ratio) totally worth it. Check out the view! 
@jregan yup. that climb from the office to the lookout tower area nearly killed me, but I made it :-)
It feels good not to be caked in SPF 100 sunscreen. Also, feels good to conquer 70 miles of cycling in one day.
Keep forgetting that Sour Patch Kids are not a valid dinner option.
@fyxation Also, I'm pretty sure I convinced my brother to build up a Quiver as a fire road bomber. @svdodge's Quiver helped in convincing :)
@jregan maybe next time I go, I hope to have some speed &amp; hill-climbing strength. Pulled muscle in leg bothered me all day.
@jregan #badumtish
@jregan Yeah, I think I'm relieved to say that I'll never be that fast.
Your JS is showing. 
@trodrigues nice! @ashedryden &amp; I will have to come say hi when we visit Berlin in August!
@ddux after a long ride yesterday (70mi) I can say that 1 bottle per hour, and lots of water and V8 when I got home seems to have helped!
Bike parking at @bendyworks! (There's 3 more bikes here but I didn't want to wheel them all over for this picture.) 
Network downtime can be scary.
@listrophy @rbxbx I have a decent (tube) mic preamp that we can try, if we have traditional 1/4" / XLR mics and not USB mics.
@listrophy @rbxbx I also have an instrument mic that might be useful, and if we have a PA that we're running, we can patch into that instead
@listrophy @rbxbx In my experience, micing a room for ambience is hard. Patching into a PA to get a clean signal is way easier ;)

@FixedFlat oh hey dude! I didn't put your twitter together with your face. Good to run into you!
Charging my iPhone off this phone charger battery brick while charging the battery brick works. I might put this on my bike as a backup…

25 mile ride tonight with @ashedryden. Cap City Trail is beautiful.
@jregan camping for days? At the lake front? (Thought this was hyperbole at first; getting there hours before sundown -&gt; camping for days?)
@jregan yeah. it is crazy. I always watched from the East Side or Kilbourn Park; I felt like that many people gathered was a bad place to be
@jregan that said, everyone in Riverwest &amp; westerly neighborhoods seems to know about Kilbourn Park &amp; the hill at the Holton Street bridge.
@jregan I'm just not a fan of crowds with a ton of drunk people, smoking people, etc. Summerfest falls under same feelings.
@jregan tactically, it's one of the worst places to be in a zombie apocalypse ;)
@listrophy lol nice. @TeslaMotors
RT @listrophy: Oh shit. @mathiasx found the list of Campfire sounds. We're DOOOOOMED!
@listrophy my animated gifs never sounded so good!
@jregan :( Don't suppose there's any way I can help make that happen?
@jregan Actually one second. I'll DM you an idea.
RT @bendyworks: What's all this, then? 
@roy @listrophy Kindling for Campfire (extension for Chrome) adds autocomplete to sounds and emoji.
I make my own notification noises.

FWIW I love you paleo diet people. We're all in this together against the crazy processed food industry.
Admiring on the bikes by this company: 
Go figure that Feedly upgrading their iOS app overloads their servers. This is why I trusted someone with scale (Google) for my RSS reader:/
@svdodge Sounds like you'll see some broken down ten speeds &amp; families of roadies who gave up &amp; settled the land at the bottom of big hills.
@trodrigues it's the servers that are down, not the app :/
@mkedave @svdodge wish I could join you guys. Have fun!
Rode my single speed bike around the block last night and my legs decided it was too hard. 1.5wks is enough time to lose that leg strength?
@trodrigues turns out it's caused by updating the Feedly client and a fix for it hasn't been approved by Apple yet. Yay walled gardens.
Recommend some music for my 4th of July playlist, internets.
I just remembered that these tires are the reason that I got Resist Nomads on my touring bike: 
I think I gotta go ride my single speed because it's worrying me that my legs might be weak now :P
@jremsikjr I'll see that and raise you Murder City Devils, particularly this track: 
Apparently July is the time to buy your winter studded tires on clearance for cheap. Who knew?
@juliepagano I go slow on my new bike and enjoy the scenery :)
Details, details. 
@juliepagano we have lots of nice places to ride in Madison; I've enjoyed discovering more and more this summer.
@juliepagano almost always on bike paths, I might add!
@jremsikjr You should be able to find it on most services (Spotify, Rdio, etc.) but here's one with some bikes in it: 
@juliepagano we might have a bike that fits you so that you don't have to rent a Bcycle all the time. Let me check &amp; see if it needs tune-up
@ashedryden @listrophy you wanna go for a ride? huh? huh?
@ashedryden @listrophy ohboyoboyoboyoboy
@listrophy @ashedryden ok. 
I made bulgur wheat and lentil pilaf. It is super tasty.
@listrophy Where would you like to go? I think @ashedryden is out.
@juliepagano lol yeah.
@listrophy Cap City Trail is 25 miles. SW Commuter Path &amp; the hills loop on Range Trail is similar but boring. Or Military Ridge? (gravel)
@listrophy Or around Lake Mendota, also 25-ish miles IIRC.
Two bowls of lentil/bulgur wheat pilaf and half an avocado. #bikefuel
@listrophy I'll meet up at Bendy at 1?
@listrophy word. See you there!
RT @listrophy: went for a 21 mi ride with @mathiasx. check it out on #strava  
@svdodge Yeah, that's quite a pace for on-street traffic.
@svdodge even though I'm recovered from my injuries, I don't know that I could sustain that clip for 1.5 miles. Tip of my hat to you.
@svdodge Meanwhile there's folks in my Strava in Madison that average 20-24mph their entire ride. Kind of blows my mind.
Wait, Clif Bar makes energy shots with caffeine? Why didn't anyone tell me?!  
@jregan this is how you win a holiday.
@svdodge yeah, sometimes when I leave work at 5PM, after sitting at a desk all day, I can spin and ride really fast. It's crazy.
@jregan :metal:
@jregan I've still got another ride planned tonight to add to today's fast ride. Then I start the beer-drinking part of the holiday as well.
@jregan Did they fix your fender braze?
I'm sleepy :(
@jregan Best of luck. I'm pulling for ya!
@NjeriChelimo I think a nap might be better!
Eying fatter tires for my Space Horse. I used to think 28c was enough, now I'm running 35s and wanting 42-45s.
@JoeSteve that bike is awesome!
@jregan yup
@srahskl yup. Loaded touring needs as much air volume in the tires as possible, IMHO.
@ashedryden I would much rather do a Jeff Goldblum movie marathon.
.@ashedryden: They said in this movie "what will people recognize in LA? Oh right, the freeway!"
"Oh, you did not just shoot that green shit at me!"
@srahskl also the 35s I have are rather slick (Resist Nomads, BMX-y tires) and I'd like something with a little tread for mud, etc.
@srahskl but all my previous bikes were 28 Gatorskins and those have always been great :)
@srahskl so far only small loads (10lbs?) but slides around in mud &amp; hard-packed sand. 30lbs gear for camping; bike can do 50 w/front racks.
Looking for a new place to ride in Madison that's in a 15 mile radius of the Capitol. What have I likely never seen in Madison, but should?
@jregan @listrophy  we can do both :) @MadisonRuby @uxmad
Realized I have access to the new Canon 6D and haven't taken any good pictures of my new bike. Now I know what I'm doing at 5PM...
New bike!  cc @tundal45 @svdodge @jregan @chrisgauger
@juliepagano yep! My Space Horse.
@jregan :D :D
@svdodge I'll be ready to tackle a ride to Milwaukee soon, but 2 weeks in Europe in August are gonna put a damper in my ability to stay fit.
@blissdev thanks!
@jregan @svdodge nice! Sounds like good customer service, for sure.
@svdodge I messed with my miles goals spreadsheet and realized that I have no idea how many miles I'll be able to do by end of August.
@jregan looking forward to riding with you at/after @uxmad! :-)
Learning to run this sewing machine. 
I'm good at sewing! part 1 
I'm good at sewing! part 2 
I took fabric from the legs of the jeans (now shorts, so I've got lots) &amp; sewed in a new piece for a new button. Old button had pulled thru.
10:30 at night is a great time to decide to rack up 25 miles on your bike.
@mathiasx in retrospect, it's not. At least not until the new headlight comes… too dark. 
@steveklabnik this thing is on my radar but probably will become personal toy (if ever available) rather than workhorse main machine :(
@steveklabnik And I totally understand the limitations going into this, economies of scale, as well as the pricepoint they're shooting for.
@steveklabnik But I'd rock a self-built 12" laptop with a retina display :D
@steveklabnik See also: 
@steveklabnik I should say that on the other hand, I've made a RaspPi useful as a dev machine before. It's not quite a MBA, but it worked.
@steveklabnik You coming to Madison Ruby?
@steveklabnik I've got a spare 256MB RAM version that I can give you. Runs Scratch, Squeak, KidsRuby, Clojure fine.. :-)
@steveklabnik My real hangup for dev was that the JVM (for Clojure) was just too slow, not enough muscle :/
rspec on a Saturday morning
Catching on TdF stages while the tests run.
@alindeman pretty good. sunny day, two laptops churning through tests (long story) and I've got plenty of coffee.
The sooner I refactor all this, the sooner I get to ride my bike! :-)
At Blue Mounds Park again. Didn't make it up the climb today but I'm taking it easy. Lots of bugs at the top. 
Just got home. I have some scrapes from falling while coming down the Blue Mound hill (hit loose gravel). More importantly, the bike is ok.
@jregan I left at about  3pm? Went for a ride earlier today with @ashedryden after noon. Total miles for the day are somewhere around 80.
I'm making burritos and fresh salsa. I don't care if its 10 o'clock at night. I'm hungry!
burrito burrito burrito. It's all parts of speech like buffalo.
@jregan not enough.. A century nonstop is a nice goal. Or a day that I do 120 miles total. Gonna attempt both before summer is over.
@ashedryden bugs :/ although those are an issue all the time lately.
Dang, this bike is nice.   
The absurdity of using cars for 3-miles-or-less trips: 
@myronmarston related: really liking rspec-fire now that I've read a little more on it.
@envygeeks +1 woo!
Making a banh mi-inspired burrito for an early lunch. Brown rice, cabbage, pickled daikon/carrot leftover from real banh mi, kale, Sriracha.
@jregan @listrophy Are you biking back? You said plans Sunday so I assume not.
@jregan @listrophy Best plan for a short ride early Saturday is probably to take the running path along Lake Mendota at the UW (it's gravel)
@listrophy yep. You bring your steel bike and I'll carry the gear ;) [guessing your road bike's tires won't like the gravel so much.]
@jregan Cool. I was gonna offer to ride partway back with you; maybe I'll ride to meet you instead?
Applying a "illuminate" filter in the Flickr iOS app crashes the app. So that's cool.
@lindseybieda this is an issue with image too dark, editing it on iPhone isn't working; Flickr actually adjusts the levels pretty well..
@lindseybieda or I could just go get my charge cable and sync my phone. But it's so... far...
@lindseybieda I wish I could conditionally wifi-sync with iPhoto. (iTunes can, but I have that turned off.)
@lindseybieda Yeah, just found out that I've never turned on Photo Stream.
I don't want to own another internal combustion car, but I might settle for building car like  at least for fun :)
Next step for Levi's commuter jean into shorts: cut out the 3M reflective tape from old legs &amp; sew in shorts 
@listrophy 
I forgot that I had to rewrite one of my things before #uxmad. Working on it now.
@listrophy Gah, sad that I'm missing this. Might head up there.
@listrophy oh ok.
@listrophy I'm too sore to move anyways.
Realized my leg has a big swollen spot. Oops. Icing it now.
Sad that most of the bike gloves out don't have padding, even when they say 'gel'. I've got a pair of MTB gloves that I love, 1/4" gel.
Here's my favorite gel gloves next to the modern gloves sold by Pearl Izumi (actually @ashedryden's gloves) 
After some research on bike gloves, I guess most people dislike gel gloves &amp; would rather have padded bars. My bars *are* padded, though!
@maryloulenhart See my earlier image tweet for what they call "gel gloves" now :(
@jregan Depends on the time. I could've worked around it, but probably better if I don't try to fit more into an already-short work week.
Anyone know about bike routes up to Devil's Lake from Madison? Looks like we'd get to take the Merrimac Ferry, which would be neat.
@sarablackthorne I wish the Madison Bike Trail went all the way to Lake Wisconsin. Oh well :/
@sarablackthorne (bike path that runs parallel to 12 for about 1/3 the way to Prairie du Sac)
@sarablackthorne I also found this: 
@sarablackthorne that might work better!
@sarablackthorne heh, now to for me to get strong enough to carry camping gear this far in a single go.. &gt;.&gt;
@sarablackthorne I'm gonna try Blue Mounds for camping first. Only 32 miles away; only big hill is the park &amp; I can always push my bike up.
@sarablackthorne I've slowly been getting light gear as it goes on sale/clearance at REI. Got a light 2person tent, Ti cookset, sleep pad.
@sarablackthorne &amp; various sleeping bag liners rather than a bag because a sleeping bag isn't necessary. I'll choose liner based on temp.
@sarablackthorne yeah I've got nice Seattle Sports bags. Not huge but they work with my rack :)
@sarablackthorne Also once I get some more money to put into my bike, I'm gonna go front S-racks to load like this: 
@sarablackthorne Seems more stable &amp; I like to be able to keep an eye on the panniers (1 of the 3 clips popped off after a bump last night)
@sarablackthorne yeah, tent, sleeping gear, etc. go on the back rack on top.

@pathlesspedaled bike slid out from me w/ a light load, coming down a hill on the Resist Nomads. Scraped up. Thinking about grippier tire.
@pathlesspedaled that's my 2 week report on riding them. They slide around in mud/loose gravel; &amp; I've been clocking a lot of gravel miles.
 is ^_^
@pathlesspedaled Yeah, 45mm might be a little too wide. I'm gonna try one of the flavors of Schwalbe Marathons next, I think.

Gah. I don't think I can do the Devils Lake ride round-trip in a day without any planning like this. I'm not even well-rested or hydrated :(

@Strabd I have some guilt about not riding at a reasonable clip &amp; spending time away from home. Haven't seen @ashedryden much this wknd.
RT @cedbrownsaid: young brothas &amp; sistas, you matter. your lives are valuable. folks are working hard to make sure *everyone* can see that.…
Sad realization that I'm probably not gonna hit my miles goal for the week for the 1st time this year. Conferences are brutal, but worth it!
Christina Peck won the NACCs (not just the 1st place women but 1st overall) for Team All-City. That's pretty awesome. 
@Matt_Wheel @tundal45 I've been eating the Clif builder bars; nibbles over an hr w/ lots of water. Tummy likes them better than other bars.
Protip for my fellow allergy sufferers: The Oology brand Kleenex is cheap at Walgreens right now, but it feels like cheap toilet paper.
Today :( 
I think these Lake Loop signs in Monona are new? 
Having an awesome smoothie at the Willy Street Coop to celebrate 60+ mile ride today. 
I went for a 63 mi ride. check it out on #strava  
So tired now. That ride destroyed me. Learned my lesson to not ride exhausted. Which means more sleep, not less riding, in the future.
@sarablackthorne  I thought the site's documentation was pretty great. Also, this is just my 2 cents, but SCSS syntax all the way. @hcatlin
@Matt_Wheel the heat &amp; wind gusts today didn't help :( most of those miles were on pavement rather than gravel.
@listrophy thanks :)
Having another smoothie, this time a tasty homemade one, after a tasty dinner cooked by @ashedryden. Because calories and because YOLO.
Weirdest dreams.
Photography friends: Recommend me a good camera bag for a DSLR?
@lindseybieda 
@tomhenrich I have no idea if this works anymore but 
@michaelseidel @NoraMKE no worries! :)
Reading from DSLR while writing Raspberry Pi image to SD card. MAX OUT ALL THE BUSES.
@chriscoyier cc @ashedryden; she does. I find it annoying when it kicks in during Netflix but whatever :)
@skolasbn @timbuk2 looks like I can't have the camera + lens ready to shoot with that bag, though?
Glad that I got battery packs for these 2 Raspberry Pi's. Takes so long to reboot.
@skolasbn Sorry, I meant the camera already has the lens attached so you can just grab the camera and shoot.
@lessfilms It was good to see you again. I'll keep you updated when there's a blog post and maybe some video of the ConcertCam project!
Slow Raspberry Pi blues.
Things are starting to work.
Fig Newtons have whey and high-fructose corn syrup now? Laaame.
@lessfilms @MadisonRuby It's just an empty repo for now with some instructions for setting it up in the README, but 
I feel old now.
I am in mad scientist mode, apparently. 
This blog post contains pictures of me being silly: 
Now that I've tried my hand at shooting a video, I start analyzing how the videos I watch online work. How they cut it up, how they pan.
I don't know how I feel about these glasses yet... 
@jasonbot2000 It's a Happy Hacker keyboard. There's a couple in the office, as well as some more exotic keyboards.
@jasonbot2000 well, a Raspberry Pi pretty much needs a powered USB hub to do anything. @daskeyboard
@anotheruiguy too big? This is what I get for ordering online...
Frustrated by the glasses thing. Change is hard, and buying online was a stupid idea. My stainless steel frames aren't available anymore :/
@gregtarnoff they don't really adjust. no nose pieces :/
@gregtarnoff the temples are wood, so they're not gonna bend. Not sure that I can return these, either. They just slide down my nose.
@gregtarnoff I read the description wrong; thought they were real wood frames with plastic arms. But it appears to be the other way around.
@gregtarnoff exactly. Lenses would go out of alignment.
@gregtarnoff but I really don't like the size or the look so I'm gonna figure out if I can exchange them.
Almost put my iPhone in a mailbox. Today is not my day.
Gah. So frustrating.
@peggysmith56 I used the same sizing; it is due to the frames being designed huge. Trying to get them returned &amp; refunded.
@cheshster already decided to return them. Sadly, they're an online order so I can't just go back to the store :/
@cheshster having such a hard time finding glasses that I like that I'm really discouraged from even trying to get another pair :(
@cheshster yeah, I've had these for 3 years.. but Zenni doesn't make them anymore. 
zomg @cheshter @Oddessy the latest Adventure Time features our collective favorite song.
@Oddessy @cheshter @ashedryden 
@cheshster @Oddessy @ashedryden Buff Baby song.
Outwitted by a coffee pot, gah.

The longer this takes to compile, the more my blood pressure rises.
@coderwall @newrelic can we get a tshirt if we already have a New Relic account?
That long extended "fuuuuck" that plays out in your brain while everything stops working.
I went for a 21 mi ride with @missingdink. All clothes now thoroughly soaked in sweat. Deets on #strava  
So @ashedryden is obsessed with the Candy Streets episode of Adventure Time.
Current status 
@lindseybieda 
@lindseybieda sorry, was biking in so I couldn't explain more. It's a remote-triggered concert camera, later to be rebuilt as a photobooth.
Canon, this is a Macbook Air. This dialog sucks, this requirement sucks. 
Seriously, Canon? #ffs 
@sarablackthorne @gregtarnoff We can remote from iMacs. It's just silly; this is the installer for the software; so you don't need the CD.
@cr8f @sarablackthorne @Canon Yeah, that led to this:

Lowepro Slingshot 202AW bag for the fancy camera is nice. Fits all the gear we need, and fits the camera, ready-to-shoot, with the big lens.
The Teensy is working and we're playing with fun things we can have it "type" when we push the giant button.

@JoeSteve yeah, dunno.
Concert_cam just worked end-to-end for the 1st time; going home now. Tomorrow I'll build a tiny UI in python's blessings &amp; build the rig.
I'm tempted to put bike on the trainer in the basement &amp; ride there to beat the heat. But I realized that it won't get tracked on @Strava.
@mathiasx and no, I don't have a bike computer. That's what iPhones are for!

Thanks to everyone that donated to my ride! It was a blast, and Team Bendyworks just rolled in to the finish line after 50 miles.
@ckittel yeah, lots of Trek people here. It's like your company employs people that like bikes or something ;)
Pfbbbbbt.

@sarablackthorne is it? I've been hiding inside recovering from the ride today.
I made a big meal of spaghetti with kale and fake meat. Yummy.

Moar sleeping!
My coffee pot is broken. Recommend me a good coffee pot, preferably with a "brew at this time" feature?

Debating a 20 mile-ish recovery ride. Feeling more up to it now that I've had some coffee.
That is some pleasant weather. I'm definitely going for a ride now.

@mdeltito @sfradkin don't really like the aero press (there's two at Bendyworks) and I have no ability to make coffee in the morning.

@steveklabnik not bugs; what I was rendering slowly converges on rendering a circle as epsilon gets smaller. Cool glitch.
@antifuchs @swannodette 
Naming things is hard.
I can feel a book buying spree coming on.
@steveklabnik trying Shoes4 now. Got distracted by reading a book. Heh.
@steveklabnik Maybe saying it in public will force me to write it, but I'm tempted to write a "retrocomputing with Shoes and Ruby" blog post
@steveklabnik gotta work on some more code. Thinking that it'd be neat to build up to introducing, say, an Adventure-alike game.
@steveklabnik And also cover some of these old graphics and math algorithms (probably with visualization for the math stuff)
When you find that an author of a book you want has released the PDF &amp; ePub of the book for free ^_^
@tundal45  Recommended here:  excited to check it out tonight.
137 books on my Goodreads to-read shelf. Let's do this :P
RT @sigmavirus24: Learning Haskell, Elixir and Clojure all at once. This is what @bendyworks has done to me.
Still hungry.
@Matt_Wheel yeah. I get a lot more reading done in the winter on the bus.

@jasonbot2000 spartan 6 is a decent FPGA. I need to get an FPGA dev board soon but looking for one with RAM and some other devices present.
@jasonbot2000 it's expensive but this has nice parts on board: 
@jasonbot2000 what kind of projects do you have in mind?
@jasonbot2000 cool. I think I'm reading  next after I finish some other books.
@jasonbot2000 with a goal of building my own basic computer from scratch b
@jasonbot2000 Also, for a little bit more $ you can get 64Mb of RAM 
@jasonbot2000 I wish there was one of these with the DDR2/3 support turned on and an appropriate RAM slot.
When is the sass rubygem gonna get libsassc?
@whazzmaster maybe I should just make a 'sassc' gem and try to make it work?
@steveklabnik finally tried my code; no dice "ArgumentError: comparison of Float with Float failed" will leave an issue w/ stacktrace later.
@steveklabnik sounds like the kind of bug I might have fun digging into :)
@JoeSteve can give yourself ulcers if you don't eat with it

At the "ok now what?" phase #keyboardhacking 
@lindseybieda Razer Nostromo + Teensy micro controller  = chording keyboard. Assuming I can get all the hardware connected &amp; then program it
Surface mount ribbon cable things are gonna be a pain to solder. Gah!
Err, I guess they're ZIF right angle connectors, SMD, for those playing along...
@kerrizor Razer's version, but same thing, sorta. Surprised to discover that it has membrane keys but whatever.
@jasonbot2000 @plural @raster know of any component to get SMD pins up to a sane pin spacing? I don't know if I can deal w/ ZIF SMD cables.
@jasonbot2000 @plural @raster I guess there's ZIF 1.0mm spaced connectors rather than the typical ZIF 0.5mm connectors but that's still tiny
@lindseybieda yeah those ribbon cables are the problem :( and the place where they're soldered in is surface mount -- too tiny to solder to
@jasonbot2000 @plural @raster gah. Already ruined one little connector thing trying to get to SMD reflow with a heat gun set at 500 degrees.
@jasonbot2000 @raster yeah I don't know how I'm gonna adapt it though. I need to use these ZIF connectors to connect to my Teensy somehow.
@jasonbot2000 @raster There's this  but I've got 6, 8, 8, and 12 pin cables :P
@jasonbot2000 @raster @plural Hmm. Looks like I can take these:  and somehow solder on 
@jasonbot2000 @raster @plural or rather,  seems to be the kind of thing I'd need.
Man, it's gonna take so many breakout boards to deal with the SMD ribbon cable things that I don't think it is worth it :(
YOLO. Buying parts to make this work.
electric bills are expensive :(
I saw online that someone had hacked a Razer Nostromo to accept Cherry MX mechanical switches, and wired them in. So I'm gonna go that route
@blissdev I haven't tried them all but like what I've tried. I really like the Topre switches in the Happy Hacker keyboard I use at work.
@blissdev I've got one of these at work, too:  but I let others use it.
@blissdev My chording keyboard is getting Cherry MX Browns, FWIW.
@blissdev nice. how are you liking the Leopold?
Ok, I think it is time to read. So tired.
@blissdev yeah my daily driver is the Happy Hacking Lite 2, I guess, so I've got arrow keys. But I use vim mode just about everywhere.
So tired. What I'm doing is going no where. Time for sleep.
Gah. So tired this morning.
@whazzmaster yeah. Mine was hosed, good enough time to tear out everything and build a chording keyboard.
Heavy load today 
@svdodge the bag on the right was heavily loaded with a big food processor, but t bounced around since the bag was kinda loose around it.
@svdodge the space horse handles the load fine, though, and I'm glad for my sturdy rack and the easy gearing.
@Brock yep I've been carrying bags of books into @bendyworks to add to the coding library.
Really glad to have @twopoint718 back in the office. I missed having really deep, interesting conversations with him.
@twopoint718 but all I'm capable of saying is "herp derp i'm a robit" so I don't know how much I contribute
OH: "That sinking feeling when the text change to a button turns into a half hour refactor of the base classes."
RT @MichaelKramer: OH: Yea box model math! It’s impossible to know if anything is really true.
aww man. static typing for the lose.
Now I see why they need all this crazy stuff like templates in C++. I don't want to write the same function for every return type.
Also proof that I don't know anything about programming at the C/C++ level anymore :(
@srahskl I needed a map function but I wanted it to handle any array.. Whoops, can't do that in C++; AFAIK have to write one per type.
Dinner is almost all from our garden: zucchini and purple kale. 
@whazzmaster @srahskl heh, I'm targeting the Arduino (AVR) so probably not C++11. I think I'm just gonna avoid this for now.
Watching TOS.
Ok. That didn't last long.
Nothing looks good :(
Oh hey, Real Genius is on Amazon Prime streaming...
Debating getting a footpedal for Meta (alt) in Emacs. Because org mode is killing me with all the Meta commands.
@twopoint718 I can tell you more, but basically: "Oh right, I can't just write a map function, I need to know what the array's type will be"
@whazzmaster @srahskl Well, it's just avr-gcc; I doubt you get any new-ish features.  
@Strabd yeah. Maybe my next hardware hacking project. The Teensy board could do it easily, and I've got tons of hardware for guitar pedals.
@trodrigues @evilhackerdude @felixge I'm thinking about building a 3 button version (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) with guitar pedal parts &amp; a Teensy.
@raganwald :) and such a good book!
RT @jackviers: @raganwald Only 1000? If you are a JavaScripter, you need to READ THIS BOOK!  
ClojureScript is the bee's knees.
That was fun but now I want to use a real library rather than implement SVG graphs ever again.
@thebestsophist yeah, d3 is too low level.
@thebestsophist yup. Doing something similar in clojurescript (the library is called C2)
Don't hit the wall, don't hit the wall.. just keep coding..
Can anyone recommend a JQuery-like library for Clojurescript? Thinking selectors, DOM manipulation is all I need.
Time to go home.
@swannodette thanks!
@boriskourt thanks! This seems to be the most popular suggestion.
I've heard enough good things about it that I've gotta watch @ID_AA_Carmack 's keynote from Quakecon 2013.
people often ask me why I ride my bike so much, and I tell them "Because a bicycle is a computer for your mind."
Shadowrun Returns lost my save file, and I wasn't really into the game, so yeah. Probably done playing it :(
And I really can't enjoy a game that thinks that showing off torture &amp; misogyny (even if it's the bad dudes doing it) is OK. So there's that

I suppose I should start a service: for $25 you tell me about your open source project and I will name it.
And if you think $25 is too much for that service: For $5 I'll listen 1/5 as much &amp; give you 1/5 of a name.

@Matt_Wheel What about "Timeshifted Destruction, Inc"?
For my PGH friends: 
@jasonbot2000 I hope to write a disassembly guide for the Razer Nostromo as a blog post this wknd. Maybe more. Waiting for keyswitches.
Morning jam. 
Found that I've got a really old draft article for my blog introducing @rethinkdb basic usage. I should get back to that someday.
@thebestsophist dunno how useful this would be, but this is relevant to our interests: 
Just found this: Gitmarks is a delicious-like bookmark engine that uses git:  
Looks like that gitmarks tool is abandoned; the bookmarklet has been broken for a long time. It's a good thing I'm building &lt;secret project&gt;
@ashedryden @konstantinhaase You can also ask @stripe not to work with him anymore.
Asking a company to not work with someone that has made misogynistic comments is a little mob rule-ish, but professionalism important online

Tired :(
@tsaleh ugh
@raster @sparkfun wow, that looks like a pretty powerful little board.
Trying to write a blog post for the first time in months, and this happens: 
This blog post about my chording keyboard is getting really long.
New blog post (very long read) "Building a Chording Keyboard: Progress So Far"  
@twopoint718 blog post complete. Possibly relevant to your interests:  warning: very long.

@jasonbot2000 let me know what you think or if you have questions.
@jasonbot2000 if I can't get the key plate cut right, I'm debating trying to make it in Sketchup &amp; get it 3D printed.. Or cut from alu plate
@haiqus @rethinkdb yeah, I'll have to figure out what has changed, too. Seems they're developing rapidly and I've been too busy to keep up.
Noodle bowls seems like a good idea for a dinner to wake up my brain and get me back in learning mode. yay? yay!
@jasonbot2000 yeah, we'll see. It's a big step to learn enough sketchup to get it right and then have it printed or CNCed.
@jasonbot2000 @bendyworks please do! :)
@listrophy I assume they didn't run you out of the state, so good job :-)
@jremsikjr @listrophy yuuuup
@jremsikjr @listrophy it's an "oh snap" too. Even more-so if I tell you know that the cast of X-Men: First Class is also in the next movie.
I didn't really get done any of the reading that I wanted to do today :(
Netflix is playing a prank on me called "Tiny Portlandia." 
Anyone reading/read Realm of Racket? Any good?
@raster what kind of performance can you expect relative to a rasp pi?
@fogus is a three letter username a requirement for being an elite hacker?
Somehow @twitter has stereotyped me as being a Firefly fan. Well, they're correct. 
Hey @twitter: when someone replies to you in a DM modal, and you were working on a reply, it wipes out the textfield. This is suboptimal.
The future is good. For $60 you can get a 1Ghz ARM board that runs Ubuntu and behaves like an Arduino. Crazy. 
@b_cran yeah, I can't agree with putting both "PC" and "Duino" in there since it is neither but the specs speak for themselves :)
Today is cleaning up the house and using that time to think and reflect.

@Blithe @MadisonRuby There can be! No official plans AFAIK. Context is: I promised to get one of my bikes tuned up for @juliepagano to ride.
@juliepagano I've got plenty of time. I'm gonna go talk to the bike shop about it; getting some fixes done on @ashedryden's bike today.
Walking by a drum circle in a park. Of course there is a drum circle; this is Madison :)
I'm doing my spring cleaning in August

@thebestsophist this tea is very good. :D
@thebestsophist I can't speak to official tea tasting, but it's like.. hints of apple pie? I've never tasted that in a tea before.
@Blithe @MadisonRuby I should mention that there's tons of bike rental stations all over Madison. Very convenient.
@Strabd I think sun tea is really just a cold extraction over time. Not sure that the sun can warm it up enough to do anything.
@Strabd Note that without a solar collector, you're never gonna warm it up to the point that hot tea is brewed.
Oh man, this one is making me LOL  cc @davidwalshblog
@thebestsophist ooo
@maryloulenhart @juliepagano I have heard good things but never done this. My crazy bike legs could probably use it.

This happens to me all the time in Madison. 
@lindseybieda it's usually a banjo in Madison, but almost always a unicycle. Sometimes a dog is running along side banjo unicycle guy.
Cleaning up my practice area and played guitar for the first time in months.
@ashedryden did you take the baby to a shooting range? This is the only way to explain why you have this picture.

Oh snap. We're gonna play hackey sack.
Just played hackey sack for like an hour and a half. We decided that we're bringing it back.
@cjibo oh man, your car runs a Microsoft product? Sorry to say, but the jokes write themselves
We can't be all the things we want to be all of the time, but maybe we can be some of the things some of the time. And that's ok.
RT @worrydream: Can't stop thinking about this. "The tools we employ at once *extend and limit* our ability to conceive the world." 
@raster yeah. Turn the combo of RaspPi + Arduino into one board on your project, and then not have to worry about integrating. Sounds good.
@jessitron doe it make sense to simplify this further and just stub the boolean to true or false, &amp; test behavior for each case?
RT @rylnd: Objects are fragile abstractions. Please don't mock them.
@steveklabnik man that's about as difficult as ordering a pizza online.
@wasbuxton this looks great! Thank you! A quick skim of the key possibility section also confirms my suspicion that I did my math wrong.
Roger on my laptop sleeve. 
I wonder what this is for… cc @twopoint718 
@blissdev yeah, @inyourdom was talking about that at lunch. This is gonna be an alt key, but it is easy to change @twopoint718
@blissdev @inyourdom @twopoint718 alt key for Emacs Org mode, that is.
@j3 @TrevorBramble I imagine you set up a private bittorrent tracker on an EC2 micro or the like.
@j3 @TrevorBramble Create .torrent on upload side &amp; push it to the tracker. Load .torrent file on the download side and away you go.
@j3 @TrevorBramble I've heard of people using this successfully:  but YMMV.
@TrevorBramble @j3 ah right.
@twopoint718 @blissdev @inyourdom I am also considering using guitar pedal parts, for a multi-button rig, but not sure about the ergonomics.
@listrophy @rylnd @jremsikjr  WHY ARE WE SHOUTING AGAIN
Lisp is so much damned fun.
Just keep truckin'...
focus? what's that? Ooo a shiny thing!
@twopoint718 just watched the part of the Carmack keynote where he talks about static analysis. It's about 1hr24mins in.
@twopoint718 and his conversion to believing in functional programming at 1:32 on.
@twopoint718 interesting to hear him attempt Haskell tutorials until he got it. He set out with a goal of writing 10k lines of Haskell.
@twopoint718 I'll try not to spoil everything, but he really digs that Lisping iOS app on his iPad for writing scheme in his downtime.
@twopoint718 so many good quotes in this. "Anything that is syntactically legal will end up in your codebase."
@twopoint718 I mean, if it isn't a major hindrance to my ability to express ideas, I think static typing is a good idea.
@twopoint718 Such a great talk.
@twopoint718 we should move our discussion here  so other BWers see it.
@twopoint718 yup
@twopoint718 that is, no, I don't mind.
Dinner and watching the Carmack keynote done, so I'm gonna go back to reading my new book: 
@cheshster yes, that is exactly what I was thinking
@twopoint718 my big reply is big.
@TrevorBramble of the Carmack keynote?
@TrevorBramble we're digging it. Fellow Bendyworker @twopoint718 &amp; I discuss it here: 
@TrevorBramble @twopoint718 It probably warrants a blog post but I'm too scatterbrained tonight.

@jf do you know @Symbo1ics ?
@jf I figured he's got that book as well as the Lisp Machine Manual, and AFAIK you're both in SF. See also 
@wasbuxton The research on speed &amp; learnability is very interesting. I have to admit that I don't expect to develop fast typing speeds.
@wasbuxton  But the novelty of building my own chord keyboard is worth the process of building one.

So tired :(
@dpaola2 Making progress, but filing the plastic to fit Cherry MX switches is very slow going. I have about 4 switches left to go.

Is anyone coming down to @bendyworks for the Scifi Book Club tonight? Let me know when to expect you (and tweet/DM me to be let in)

@Clint326 but it's not the same!
It's scifi book club times, folks! Hop in that hangout!
Hugh Howie just joined the Scifi Book Club hangout for Wool!
@dpaola2 They're membrane switches, so the PCB is part of the switch. Wouldn't be hard to work around, but the traces are all SMD (small)too
@dpaola2 I can take pictures to show you what I mean when I get home.
@dpaola2 sorry, I should've updated my post: I've since learned that the Belkin models (cheaper), use regular wire &amp; are easily modded.
@dpaola2 this is what the membrane keyboard and its PCB look like 
@dpaola2 I might try to design a new plate that can be 3D printed for Cherry MXs. So far dremeling out the old plate hasn't destroyed it.
@dpaola2 also worth noting that the nostromo is pretty fun stock as a gaming peripheral :-)
You can't bottle lightning.

@raster thanks! I might be in MKE soon. We'll see.
1Password frequently requiring new versions to be bought in the App Store and new licenses for the desktop app is really frustrating.
After trying to fight with SLIME configuration in Emacs for like half an hour, I have to say, life's too short for this shit.
@mathiasx I'm just gonna use the SBCL repl and copy paste. That always works.
@tundal45 I think LastPass is pretty horrible, but we use it for team passwords.
@tundal45 Design &amp; UX is very good in 1Password. Mobile app is useful. But they keep finding reasons to require existing users to buy again.
@tundal45 Yeah, I don't know that I trust LastPass's servers with my data. Why do I trust DropBox more? I shouldn't, TBH.
Complaining about shit on Twitter is also a good way to get distracted from the thing you were doing. I am failing today.
@sigmavirus24 despite getting a few searches for using Bootstrap in Octopress, I don't really find it interesting to write about.
@twopoint718 yeah, of course. I got it installed &amp; running but it blows up &amp; doesn't stay connected to buffer. I don't have time to fix it.
When it comes down to it, Clojure is really, insanely great.
@twopoint718 word. And LightTable can't talk to Common Lisp yet, because an instarepl would be nice here.

Hacking on Lisp. This is my soundtrack:

@tundal45 @steveklabnik I start with the best of intentions, but with no fees looming &amp; no in-person lecture to attend, I fall off.
@coreyhaines often used to be able to use the thing that was just deleted, so I don't think it is going away.
@coreyhaines However, I would support a version of 'reject' that took 1 arg &amp; returned a new, modified array.
Shouldn't be surprising, but Google Account Activity shows it stores all the places I invoked Google Maps (all of the places I've been.)
It gets even more surveillance-y, despite being interesting: what Google knows about my activities cc @Matt_Wheel 
Basically, Google knows everything about you. Where you've been, who you meet with, who is trying to contact you, what you buy.
You are a product and the history trail of what you do and what you pay attention to is what is for sale by large web companies.
@Matt_Wheel I cannot easily opt out of all the technology that enables this.
@Matt_Wheel I have a big footprint from working with computers, but less-technical people using Facebook, etc generate A LOT of this data.
@Matt_Wheel And of course, they have no idea.
@1Password As a developer, I should know better than to assume that maintenance and new features can be built without income.

How do you implement lotts of business rules in an OOP way without a ton of conditionals? Strategy pattern from GoF doesn't seem to fit.
@isaacsanders Let's say an extraordinary amount of decisions must be made to render a page. Something like 100 different branches of logic.
@isaacsanders How would you build that to handle all of those cases and be flexible in the future?
@isaacsanders Decisions are made at lots of levels of the request/response cycle, too...
@isaacsanders added complexity that many services behind the app may be queried to get data to make a decision.
@isaacsanders Maybe shared state on the request means you'd only make those service requests once each, but still complicated.
@isaacsanders not an easy problem to solve. I don't know that "patterns" are gonna help me here.
@isaacsanders problem is just building the system in the first place. Feels like it needs a different architecture than scattered decisions.
@isaacsanders I need to propose a solution, hence why I'm soliciting advice on twitter :&gt;
@isaacsanders *that* I probably can't convince them to change.

@jclermont healthcare should be a basic human right. So equally true for everyone, regardless of their current situation.

@gregtarnoff @jclermont to really disrupt healthcare or health insurance, you'd need way more venture capitol than any other startup.
@gregtarnoff @jclermont and then you may not be a startup that is really solving anything that that point, just joining the club.

@Wendy_RM Thank you for being a friend :-) I'm really glad that we got to spend time together at #madcity13. We need to do this more often.
Productivity through the roof. Thinking of you, @steveklabnik :p 
@steveklabnik in retrospect I wasn't paying any attention to the lyrics so there was no more implied there than the the song title pun.
@dubharmonic So @steveklabnik has been telling us all for years that listening to pop music is great for productivity. In particular, Ke$ha.
I have so much content for this talk, and I've gotta cut it way down. I have to figure out how to do so without losing the message &amp; value.
@dubharmonic @steveklabnik I still facet on it and the lyrics. I dunno.
We're out of almonds, so I'm tempted to walk to Walgreens and get some. but in truth I'll probably just buy energy drinks &amp; candy.

@2john4tv btw saw the business card you gave @steveklabnik and they are hilariously awesome! Great idea.
@gazoombo @cczona There's all sorts of terribleness related to modern global economy around food. For example: quinoa.
@gazoombo @cczona It's a great complete protein. But its popularity raised the price, taking it away from the people who eat it as a staple.

@funkatron thank you for this talk, and thank you @MadisonRuby for facilitating a safe place to discuss these issues.
@silentbicycle super-short reply is that my code is all abstracted into Arduino libraries (c++ classes) that try to isolate side effects.
@silentbicycle I'm working on a blog post to show refactoring the code out into classes &amp; then testing with mocks for Arduino-provided libs.
@silentbicycle test runs happen on the PC rather than the Arduino, which I like. Some level of integration testing on device is future work.
@silentbicycle I just made little mock classes for Serial, Button, etc. and include them. So far it is manageable, but my code is simple.
Pear programming 
I hate box model.
Kids these days don't know about the 80's.

This is your reminder that if you block a brand on Twitter, Twitter will still show you promoted tweets from that brand. You are the product

@aresnick I block the account of any promoted tweet I see; still seeing those accounts (in Twitter web app) on the next promoted tweet.
@nk @aresnick *shrugs* I doubt it's a conspiracy. Might make sense if brands demand in their contracts that all twitter users are shown ads.

@Carols10cents it's not bad; just a little slow. Time to start thinking about scaling issues and getting some hardware donated?
@maryloulenhart @Carols10cents people. also promoted tweets. :P
@Carols10cents "here" in that msg was when I was posting on Rstatus -- I meant I need to figure out what picture host to use on rstatus!
@Carols10cents no worries! &lt;3 storing photos would be a huge step. lots of storage costs.
@Carols10cents That works, too. I'll see about whether folks here would be interested in getting our own node started up.
Hey @rstatus hackers -- any thoughts on encrypting communication between nodes and/or encrypting messages in the datastore?
Twitter stahp. Twitter. Stahp.
@Carols10cents trying to spin up a new node on Heroku pointed out some bugs that don't happen in dev. Hoping I have time to issue PR tonight
@Carols10cents also seriously tempted to port the data store to Datamapper on Postgres because mongo is expensive.
@lindseybieda @Carols10cents seemed like you can't have a new node without data in the data store? Need to investigate more when I get home.
@cdwort I have heavily hacked  with Compass replacing the stock CSS files &amp; a watchr script 
@cdwort I don't recommend that setup though -- I go with Keynote for real talks. Too much rabbit hole / yak shaving in that stack.

Really tempted to take the base ideas here and rewrite. So tempted.
lol feels good 
@twopoint718 currently porting to postgres with data_mapper. We'll see where that goes.
@twopoint718  if you want to start hacking; first step is to get tests passing
@twopoint718 well, maybe before test passing is to start removing the MongoMapper code.

@TheOtherZach that cold got me last week. Luckily, vitamins and rest seemed to chase it off pretty quickly.
Icing ankle on one leg &amp; knee on the other; I realized that I am still sore from the 100 mi ride and I need to recover before bike camping.

Bike friends: Can you recommend a handlebar bag w/ map window that will easily hold my iPhone, dynamo=&gt;USB charger brick, and battery pack?
My bike can now charge USB. Huzzah. I'm at like 99% ready to go camping and just want to /go/ already. One more day...
My front battery-powered light is charged off USB, too. I've got one of the Cyolite lights. cc @lindseybieda
I got a pull request accepted on @emacs_live today. woot!
@jregan not necessarily. If saves me from what I do now, which is carrying a pannier almost all the time for tools + locks..
@jregan I don't know that the map holders will hold an iPhone well, and the "iphone stem/handlebar mount" cases/bags don't fit battery pack.
@jregan I'll check out the Arkel stuff. Thanks! I don't know that I can get it before my bike trip on Tuesday but maybe!
@gesa May I suggest playing  with the screen brightness down to fill your time? :-)
@jregan Just to Blue Mounds and then day trips from there -- Tuesday to Friday, back Friday or Saturday. @ashedryden is coming :-)
@jregan I guess Budget Bikes has the Arkel bags, so I will go look at them tomorrow. I suppose I'll have to look at my bike gear budget ;)
@jregan @ashedryden well, it's paved from Military Ridge trail, so it's not bad to push it.. Maybe 10 minutes walking up to bike campground.
Another bike friends question: Do you know if they take debit cards for campground sites at State Parks? Or do I need cash?
@lindseybieda @gesa so much fun :-)
@sarablackthorne Blue Mound Park site doesn't list it :(
OH: I can't believe the sounds that are coming out of this thing - @chrisgauger playing my ukulele.

Cycling out t Blue Mound park this morning. Going to camp for a few days. Finally get to do this bike camping thing.
@jregan at least it is cooler than it has been!
Camping mode. (For 2 people worth of gear.) 
Gah. I think I figured out my mechanical (front wheel problem) and I need to go back.
I'd rather get this mechanical problem (some really loose spokes) taken care of than break down 30+ miles from home. Back to the bike shop!
Live and let live.

What was that open source tool to backup to AWS S3/Glacial with strong encryption?
@silentbicycle that's it. Thanks!
@gazoombo @cperciva depending on whether users can use their own AWS accounts or not for tarsnap, you can set S3 bucket to copy to Glacial.
@gazoombo fortunately, the plan is only to dump data into Glacial. If disaster strikes, I will pay whatever to get the data back. @cperciva
@gazoombo Maybe if the data is already in S3, it's overkill. The benefit would be if I can delete old incremental backups to make S3 cheaper
@gazoombo my reason is that Dropbox wants $100/year, and the thing filling up my free plan is some small backups.

@perisaccadic in other parts of my talk, I talk about looking for potential. Hiring people that impress your team. @lindseybieda @Strabd

@steveklabnik @lindseybieda there goes my ability to say vegan because other people are more militant (I depend on the term's assertiveness)
@lindseybieda @steveklabnik "vegetarian" is such a meaningless word now that I found that other people would try to decide what I could eat.
@lindseybieda @steveklabnik *decide for me, even. And/or argue with me about food stuff. Vegan has a nice "I made up my mind" finality to it
@juliepagano @lindseybieda @steveklabnik People in the US have this great culture where they never bother to learn (or ask) other people.

@gilesgoatboy Or maybe a better way to say what I have in mind is something with a tiny drum grid and some sort of C64 SID-y synth voice.
@franklinwebber It's not yet, but I am gonna need playtesters for a puzzle design I'm working on, soon! Will tweet the link.
@franklinwebber honestly current codebase needs a lot of love and there's nothing playable there yet.
@franklinwebber What if I told you about  which is not my game? :P @listrophy
@listrophy @franklinwebber nope. but right now it is really interesting :)
@listrophy @franklinwebber I pushed this earlier today but it isn't finished. More puzzles need to be written 
Terrible, hacky JavaScript that I wrote for prototype quickly showed brittleness and un-DRY copying. Thinking I need ClojureScript.
@gilesgoatboy the thing I've run into &amp; will caution about is the 3+ different ways you can do audio in HTML5 or JS. I chose Web Audio API.
How do I wipe and reinstall Mac OSX if I don't have a superdrive? Gotta wipe my old MBP that got an SSD drivebay kit.
@jclermont I don't think I have an SD card around :( Gotta do this tonight, too.
@sarablackthorne @gregtarnoff honestly, I don't have the DVD either, so it probably won't help.. and trying to get this done tonight.
@jclermont @blissdev @antifuchs turns out I never purchased Mountain Lion, either. My MBA came with it. Doh.
Gah. This is what I get for leaving a laptop neglected in a closet and then deciding to do something with it :(
@blissdev @antifuchs @jclermont I can only buy it on the MBP, which I'd rather wipe than have it upgrade first then wipe to reinstall. Hrm.

@Jonplussed that's a good way to put it. My issue is always in keeping the inertia over many months.
@KevinZuhn @bobbylox it's certainly very interesting to me right now as I start to integrate a puzzle engine into my game engine :)
@rbxbx even worse, I know better &amp; can write better JavaScript. Or I could rewrite it as CoffeeScript. But I might as well take the plunge.
@jasonbot2000 yep! I just gotta write a "deploy" script that packages my game up in it &amp; makes exe's, dmg's, etc.

@gilesgoatboy I don't know if I want to provide that many different pieces of functionality TBH.

@gazoombo I haven't found anyone in favor of it, yet!
As tempting as is to throw together a little AMD-powered Mini-ITX db server with a ton of disks and BtrFS, I'm gonna wait a little bit more…
@mathiasx clarification: ton of disks = 4x 1Tb HDDs and 2x 128Gb SSDs.
@tundal45 BtrFS is a new Linux-based block-level FS, like ZFS.. blend together speed of SSDs with storage of HDDs as one block device for OS
@blissdev Well, the hope would be that for document stores like MongoDB and RethinkDB it'd scream.
@blissdev But those two databases have very different technical choices and so very different bottlenecks in play under load/scale.
@blissdev @tundal45 Really, it's about the current CPUs and RAM I can cram on a Mini-ITX mobo. Too limited. My MBA would outperform it.
@blissdev @tundal45 But, if I can wait a year to get a lot more CPU + RAM in that size, it'll be more economical than EC2 instances.
@blissdev @tundal45 Or put another way, it'd be a waste of money to build it right now, but waiting should let me build a nice server.

@gazoombo Yeah, I'm hoping to have a Chef config for building a linux workstation with my config and preferred tools soon.
@gazoombo All things considered, $80/month for a year costs less than another laptop...

There seems to be some old ways of installing Ubuntu over network console, but I don't have the ability to mount/modify Linux ISOs on here.
@gazoombo So we'll see if a 2.8Ghz Sempron and 1gb DDR3 cuts it. Guessing I'll need some more RAM really soon.
@gazoombo yeah. And as I learned with  last night, I may need to try &gt;1 server for RethinkDB performance. We'll see.
@gazoombo So this will help me decide if I should build out a stack of mini-ITX servers.
@gazoombo This seems to be a solution that's working.. but still in the install process

New idea involves flashing new Ubuntu live USB key, using VMware to boot it, modify it, verify it has SSH, then booting server from that.

@tundal45 I am tempted to binge watch as much of The West Wing over the next couple days as I can. Must. Resist.
@begriffs 
Doggie walking. 
Debating the relative merits of each caffeine delivery system I have at my disposal to warm up with.
So coffee. Yum.
Ordered a Fitbit Force. Ready to begin tracking more of my life and throwing it all into a database where I'll probably ignore the data XD
Using Voice to Code Faster than C? 
T-minus 10... 
Looks like they're holding it at the pad. Still waiting for launch.. cc @listrophy
@yaxu oh cool - livecoding music in Haskell while a percussionist plays real drums?
What was the more interesting book you read in the last year?
@gazoombo Yeah I figure I'm gonna upgrade and/or add other devices eventually, but I want to start tracking data now.
Is this Com Truise?
RT @cstross: . @jamesk Say what you like, the neo-reactionaries are a *better class* of wingnut. Smarter, crazier, less boringly conformist.
RT @cstross: . @po8crg However the anti-feminist/anti-egalitarian subtext in the neo-reactionary cant makes me think there’s some overlap w…
Lol I have news anchor hair.
"Siri, remind me not to eat as much on Thanksgiving."
@gazoombo I really need to get to @LambdaJam next year!
@RedQueenCoder @bendyworks I'm a really big fan of @aphyr's guides so far:  and for a book: Joy of Clojure by @fogus.
@willhaynes @southpolesteve Seen the Odroid? Or that Arduino-compat board that runs Ubuntu? Lots of cool little Linux boards right now!
Verified by Visa is so gross.
@willhaynes @southpolesteve ODroid:  New Arduinos: 
OH: Cats don't know what good music is.
Recommend me men's fashion tumblrs?
How is it possible that I'm hungry? :(
@shadowspar For me, the server 500'd in the middle of the Verified by Visa step. Luckily, the order eventually showed up on original site.
@lindseybieda "Trust this site with a random URL to verify that your Visa card is correct!" is so phish-y it hurts.
@lindseybieda That's why I default to Amazon.. plus we have Prime...
@cheshster Fancy suit advice.
@ashedryden @cheshster I'm all :P
Where did headache come from?
@thebestsophist I've heard good things about Predictably Irrational. Worth reading?
@cheshster like this. #nocontext 
Being sick leads to me rambling. Apparently.
Has anyone gotten MobileOrg working/syncing with their desktop org mode? Mind helping me out if you have?
Dear fellow devs: when you're discussing pieces of software, please say "it does this" rather than "he does this". Noticing this used often.
@ruhee_ now that I'm aware of it, it jumps out at me in many conference talks; seems almost always to appear in speech and never in writing.
@twopoint718 sure, and I even am fine with "this guy" but saying "he does this" adds a gender unnecessarily.
@twopoint718 
@twopoint718 Short explanation of why: It's not that generic he was a conscious effort, but it encourages a male-centric view of the world.
@twopoint718 This isn't a stop-the-presses issue, either. I just find it kinda grating now that I'm aware of it whenever it comes up.
So that is why no one has been getting my email sent through iOS's share stuff. 
sick :(
@Matt_Wheel I am fairly certain that sending email through Mail.app hasn't  worked since I restored my phone, &amp; I didn't notice until today
Where/how does iBooks.app store notes?
@Jonplussed congrats!
Given a string of gibberish and a goal, a system that invents a prog lang that accomplishes the goal with the gibberish string as a program.
I'm sure someone's already thought of this, but it's worth putting out there as a #freeidea.
Seems the problem with my phone and Mail.app is that it was previously connected it to Gmail, before restore. But now it's not connected.
I don't understand why the Google docs for iPhone Mail.app only work if you've never connected your Gmail app, but they don't work for me.
Is anyone running on iOS without the Mail.app integration? That is, they only use apps that can send email through Gmail.app?
Suspect that when I get email working through iOS on my phone again, a bunch of drafts from weeks ago will suddenly send &gt;.&gt;
@gazoombo Yeah, that's the reason I'm asking about it; I've long since switched to Gmail, but "Mail this" anywhere in iOS goes thru Mail.app
Got so little done today. Being sick is frustrating.
@gazoombo Yeah; I guess MobileOrg doesn't really work very well for others that I talked to, and having standards for PIM-like stuff is nice
Eep.
What do you use on your iOS device that helps you with your job?
@jasonbot2000 I need to try out Bittorrent Sync
I am a strange loop but I'd really like to be a strange map.
@mathiasx Mostly to decrease my off-by-one errors.
@sigmavirus24 they remove Java during the Mavericks upgrade. Gave me an excuse to get a newer JDK…
Lisping is a great app for writing Scheme on iOS. TIL about loading in text files and copying code out to export. 
@listrophy I've had one for awhile. A lot of people do but don't talk about it for obvious reasons.
RT @ashedryden: How do we get people to pay attention when this happens so they aren’t shocked when we say many don’t participate in OSS du…
@lucasmazza @steveklabnik @alex_gaynor yeah, commit existed but was rebased out of master. Github keeps all.
I know some people are in the "trust and give everyone commit bit" camp, but I am in the "be careful who you trust your project with" camp.
Star Wars radio play as done by all your favorite voice actors. Enjoy! 
A shower is a device for generating ideas. And getting yourself clean.
So many projects; so little time.
Huh, so Mt. Gox doesn't do withdrawals through Dwolla anymore. How are people getting BTC-&gt;USD if not through Mt. Gox?
@aphyr Similar for me, but scaled down; putting together a server w/ 16Gb RAM, 128Gb SSD, 4Tb HDD server for running my data-intensive app.
@aphyr This stuff is so cheap now. 16Gb RAM should be a minimum on new boxes.
This is now my go-to background music: Ascenseur pour l'échafaud (Lift To The Scaffold) by Miles Davis on @Rdio: 
@maxlynch @listrophy seconded.
RT @maxlynch: If you offer unpaid internships, please fix that. It's not a good thing and we can do better.
insert meme image "lol my terminal was so messed up there it was echoing characters in Klingon lol olol"
Who knew that my brain required so many config files that needed to be filled out.
@mathiasx luckily they're not XML.
How are people implementing worker queues on Clojure these days?
Feeling dumb because I don't know how to install a jar locally into my lein project and I've forgotten everything about Java dev. Derp.
@aphyr So far BtrFS is proving a good solution; haven't really tried ZFS on Linux before.
@TheOtherZach honestly you spend very little time bogged down by any legacy Java stuff like XML or jar's.
@jasonbot2000 @adafruit That's a good idea &gt;.&gt; I need more components for my wearable projects.
@TheOtherZach seriously, though, leiningen is probably the best tool I've ever used. Blows away the Ruby toolset.
RT @mihi_tr: Is it just me or is jacking into your server with nrepl and changing things on the fly while developing plain awesome?
@antifuchs Hmm. I guess they do exchange but I always thought that was a hosted wallet, which I'm really wary of.
@AaronToponce @aphyr Truth.
@AaronToponce @aphyr This isn't some in-production app for a real client, though, just a personal project, so it fits well.
@antifuchs lol. I just want USD out at this point.
@jonwbrumbaugh yeah! Maybe lunch next week some time?
Datomic 👍
@jonwbrumbaugh Tuesday is looking best.
@Wendy_RM congrats!
@twopoint718 my family was raised on O&amp;H Kringle.
@twopoint718 nice! My mom's family is from there, right by O&amp;H.
@whazzmaster @twopoint718 Ah, you're from a Lehmann family. That explains so much :P #ikeed
Finished some features on my side project tonight. Super pumped. Now it just needs a UI layer to be useful &gt;.&gt;
Mwahahaha.

Fuuuuuuu
I miss @ashedryden already :(
RT @GreatDismal: RT @don_mcarthur Prank story on Hacker News re: Bitcoin encryption keys leak = $250 plunge?  
I made some good progress today, but I should change gears for awhile. Feeling blech.
@ReinH @ashedryden me too.
love is all you need. s/love/coffee/
Looking for a dentist. Not sure I can trust one with broken images on their site and links that go to 404's.
@listrophy there is a footer link for their web hosting company and the domain is expired 😭
Who's got a bad cold and isn't afraid to sneeze all over himself? This guy.
@whazzmaster protip: Ecstatic doesn't have any blogging features built in 😁
lol lol caffeine face wash. Yes please! 
Recommend me something entertaining to watch.
@juliepagano that'd be a waste of coffee
@lindseybieda ^5
The frustration of a limited primate brain, one currently gummed up by a head cold.
Youtube 2x speed is great for these long educational talks so that I can get lost in half the time.
@listrophy did they announce drone delivery tonight?
@listrophy maybe they'll do burrito fulfillment for us.
I think the new Earth Balance containers were designed for Amazon Drone delivery. 
So I think this is having the effect that Amazon intended.

RT @listrophy: CouchBaseLite. Doing iOS? Check it out. Super-easy replication.
Ugh. I don't wanna be sick anymore.
Of all the things I've used for storing data in iOS (which is none), I like Couchbase the most so far.
@aphyr Do you have anything up online on the box you're putting together? Gist  listing the parts or something?
I might be too sick for physically hosting the scifi book club tonight, guys. cc @whazzmaster
@whazzmaster Can you run it tonight via the hangout?  I'll try to make it if I can.
@whazzmaster I just hope people read their email before heading down to Bendyworks...
